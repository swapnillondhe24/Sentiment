"Wrong specification Listed Anti Viral PM2.5 Filter is not there in this Model, Horrible Installation","Wrong specification Listing on Amazon : Model GLS18I3FWAMC Lloyd 1.5 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC Anti Viral PM 2.5 Filter in not available in this Model (Model is Same as Listed and got the Same Model from Lloyds , So its not an issue of Wrong Product delivered) Even the Lloyds itself is not Claiming this feature in this Model. Its an Error from Amazon. Amazon should compensate me and all others who bought this AC for this missing feature. Product Quality : Using it for 5-6 days now ...was earlier using Hitachi Inverter 3 Star AC ..... Cooling is not as good as Hitachi, What's most annoying is the  Temperature Control ......even after running on best settings this AC makes you feel ""Too Cold"" & ""Too Hot"" ....very often .......I never experienced this in Hitachi Inverter AC Horrible Installation & Cheating on Installation Charges by LLoyds : Lloyds sent untrained novice technicians for installation , they have no knowledge about this AC or its features , They drilled wrong holes then forced the plastic gittis by hammer which caused breakage of most of the gittis and when I told them to screw the screws by screwdriver ..they didn't listened and hammered  the screws in the gittis (this is wrong way of doing) Not just that , they charged me Extra Rs 500- in the name of Nitrogen flushing ......which they didn't even do in the end.....and directly started the AC. I protested and told them that Nitrogen flushing is part of every installation protocols of AC's whether on new pipe line or on old pipe lines  ....But they said they will install without Nitrogen flushing and they will  not be responsible if your product gives lesser cooling and develops faults soon. Amazon and Lloyds both should look into this matter","10 May 2023","Style Name: 2023 Model - 3 Star","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61AhYB8v+HL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Vanshika","1.0","Lloyd 1.5 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC (5 in 1 Convertible, Copper, Anti-Viral + PM 2.5 Filter, 2023 Model, White, GLS18I3FWAMC)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0BRKXTSBT/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=one_star"
"We are a loyal customer of Amazon but now we are deeply hurt and feel cheated .","This is in regard to our recent purchase of a Lloyd Split A.C. of 'supposedly' 1.5 ton, 3 Star. We feel that the product delivered to us is of 1 ton (though the sticker on the side decodes as 1.5 ton). This was the first impression of the installer company as well as the Lloyd - Havell's technician's impression by the physical appearance. I have been calling up Amazon personel repeatedly to help us with the issue but only to hear that the Return window closed on 23 April 2023. Earlier we did not initiate a return/replacement of the AC as we are no expert in understanding the capacity and stopping installation of a product by physically seeing it. We could only question the installer/ Lloyd -Havells technician to understand what might have happened, and what their impression was about the size of the unit. We anticipate that a Lloyd-Havells 1 ton A.C has been delivered to us by Amazon, though we paid for a 1.5 ton A.C. We are deeply hurt and felt cheated. We have been an ardent and loyal customer of Amazon online sales for a very long time. Our records would show that. A few months ago we bought an LG 340 litres refrigerator. We have never found Amazon sending us wrong products erroneously. But now we are in doubt. Sincerely hoping to be heard and expecting for a resolution as soon as possible. Can we be proved that the Lloyds model supplied is genuinely a 1.5 ton 3 star split AC.","07 May 2023","Style Name: 2023 Model - 3 Star","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71I8OsuawNL._SY88.jpg

"replace my ac","The media could not be loaded. Dear team I am writing to complain about the LLYOD Inverter Air Conditioner I purchased on March 2023. The AC worked fine for a few weeks, but suddenly the compressor stopped working. Almost after 3 days, the service team came and checked the AC and said the gas leaked. The next day, they came to take the AC to their workshop for repair. I called them after two days, and they told me they would return the renovated AC within a few days. I waited a week for their response, and finally got installed the renovated AC they said the complaint occurred due to the gas leak Again after a week, an irritating sound was produced by the AC while working. I informed the service centre about it. they came and inspected the ac and took a video of the condenser unit, they said this video clip would be forwarded to the company and let me know the result. Unfortunately, the next day after their inspection, Aircondition stopped working, only the fan was working even though the compressor was ON, and the AC  was not providing cool air. what kind of build quality are you using? really sick and tired of your new air conditioner, replace me with a new unit, I don't want this welded ac (to clear the gas leak they had solder two ends of the compressor unit.). I don't want this two-month-old ac which is not working. I had to suffer a lot due to this messed up ac. My aged mother is now suffering from the heat. replace my ac with the new unit. I don't want this damaged unit at all. my complaint Ticket Number is 10052321395523.

"After Service of Lloyd is pathetic","1. The technician will charge you 80% extra from the market price for any additional equipment. 2. You will start getting faults in the ac from the very first week of installation. 3. Lloyd customer service will not help you in any situation. 4. Every time you will see a new technician coming and finding a new problem in the AC. 5.  After a month you cannot return or exchange the item as well. 6. Technician will come and ask to pay for something which is already paid and given in the warranty otherwise they don’t even care whatever is the problem. 7. Technicians don’t carry any equipments so they can make excuses to get away from fixing the problem. 8. When you call their customer service they always say we cannot do anything, they can only forward the complaint. All of the above I experienced in the very first month of the installation.

"Initial Product Review - Pathetic Installation Experience","This is an Initial Product Review on Installation, Might update ot later after some months of Use. Product Review - Good Product at this price Range. Good Cooling capacity, sufficient for upto 160sqft room size. Good Features. Remote has radiant and good quality. Installation Review- Sum up in one word - Pathetic Experience. I used my own outdoor stand unit, when asked installation executive to use that he asked me extra installation amount than the complete installation charges. The wire for AC was charged 3X for extra requirements than what's in the box. No Branded. No reciept. The water pipe was not on the box, so executive charged me around 3X of normal market price. No reciept. The Executive do not had proper equipment or accessories, he used tapes to stick the wire on wall instead of pins. Attached Image. Over-all, it was a pathetic experience on installation part. Llyod should close their installation services. Notes for New Users- Have your own Plug before in hand. Have your own Outdoor AC Unit Stand. Have your own extra wires if switch is far away. be more vigilant when Executives asks for extra charges. I have raised a complaint with Amazon but they keep putting me on Hold. I'll escalate it to all social platforms if no action taken within time.","20 Mar 2023","Style Name: 2023 Model - 3 Star","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61AsSnsi4wL._SY88.jpg

"Installation is not proper","We have to opt for brand installation for proper warranty. But the brand installation does not do good work. For me only one person came for installation and the mandatory vaccum of pipes before releasing the gas was not done. This can cause serious issues in the AC. Before installation please ask the technician if he is having all the equipment's. Vaccum is mandatory and not a choice. The installation book that comes along with the product also talks about it.","05 May 2023","Style Name: 2023 Model - 3 Star","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615EZpo7SJL._SY88.jpg

"Amazing Cooling Power","I would be happy to write a review for an air conditioner on Amazon! I purchased this air conditioner for my bedroom and I am blown away by its cooling power! The unit quickly cools down the room and maintains a comfortable temperature throughout the night. But what really impressed me was inspite of being small in size(indoor) it gets the job done. The unit is also incredibly easy to use. The remote control is intuitive and the LED display on the front of the unit is easy to read. I particularly appreciate the timer function, which allows me to set the unit to turn off after a certain amount of time so I don't have to worry about wasting energy. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend this air conditioner to anyone in need of a reliable, energy efficient cooling solution. Only cons i found is the size of indoor unit it looks like 1ton. But it cools the room fastly.","24 Apr 2023","Style Name: 2023 Model - 3 Star","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71h64ddXdzL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Ravi Kumar","4.0","Lloyd 1.5 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC (5 in 1 Convertible, Copper, Anti-Viral + PM 2.5 Filter, 2023 Model, White, GLS18I3FWAMC)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0BRKXTSBT/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star"
"Installation was fast but","Got the ac on 22nd Apr 2023 and installation got done on the second day and the guys who came to install knew what they were doing but it costed me 4200, not that I’m against those guys but the company should provide installation parts if they are charging 34k for the AC and 999 for installation. Charged me like this: ₹850/m copper wire- 2 meter ₹100/m wire- 4 meter ₹850 stand ₹100 plug ₹1180 installation + gst Total 4230 which I think is a little expensive 😩 but im satisfied with the work as of now.

Pros: • Budegt friendly • Effective cooling • Compact in size with big outer unit • Easy installation Cons: Since its been one week only so there is no such negative points as of now.

"Amazing AC","The air conditioner is an essential appliance for anyone living in a hot and humid climate. I recently purchased the air conditioner, and I have been extremely satisfied with its performance. One of the first things I noticed about this air conditioner is how easy it was to install. It came with clear instructions and all the necessary hardware, and I was able to get it up and running in just a few minutes. Once it was installed, I was impressed by how quickly it cooled down my room. Within minutes, I could feel a noticeable difference in the temperature. Another thing I appreciate about this air conditioner is how quiet it is. I can barely hear it running, even when I'm sitting right next to it. This is a huge plus, especially when I'm trying to sleep at night. The air conditioner also has a lot of features that make it really convenient to use. It has a remote control that allows me to adjust the temperature and fan speed from across the room, and it has a timer function that I can use to set it to turn on or off at specific times. I also like the energy-saving mode, which helps to reduce my electricity bill. Overall, I would highly recommend the air conditioner to anyone looking for a reliable, efficient, and convenient way to cool down their home or office. It's a great investment that will help you stay comfortable and productive even on the hottest days.","22 Apr 2023","Style Name: 2023 Model - 3 Star","","Yes","Prime Customer","5.0","Lloyd 1.5 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC (5 in 1 Convertible, Copper, Anti-Viral + PM 2.5 Filter, 2023 Model, White, GLS18I3FWAMC)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0BRKXTSBT/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star"
"Best inverter AC in the 1.5ton segment","I had bought the Llyod Ac 15 days ago after checking on the reviews online. This Ac is a very fast cooling one.Since the compressor unit of this ac is larger compared to other brands like voltas the cooling efficiency is better .The cooling also remains for a good amount of time as per my experience.Also the cooling temperature  need not be kept lower than 26°C for a perfect ambient atmosphere. Cheapest among other ac's in the 30k range. Also please do install a stabilizer for extra safety.","09 May 2023","Style Name: 2023 Model - 3 Star","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61569cR+24L._SY88.jpg","Yes","Sreekumar Sreejith","5.0","Lloyd 1.5 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC (5 in 1 Convertible, Copper, Anti-Viral + PM 2.5 Filter, 2023 Model, White, GLS18I3FWAMC)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0BRKXTSBT/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star"
"Great Value","Started using this AC a few days back and was very skeptical before ordering. Many of my friends said to go woth LLYOD OR VOLTAS and due I found this model from Llyod is cheaper in Amazon. Also i get 1.5ton for the price of 1 ton. Hence ordered. One thing I was very skeptical after ordering was in online model they only provide 1 year component Warranty whereas in offline model you'll get 5 year. Then after the AC arrived it was sticked in AC as 5 year Component Warranty. Then I installed Havells Sync app and registered my AC and boom... I saw my warranty has been extended. So the thing is you must register your product with Havells to claim 5 year component Warranty. When it comes to cooling, it cools my room way faster. If only got 2 way Swing but it's not a deal breaker for me atleast. Satisfied with the buy so far.","19 Apr 2023","Style Name: 2023 Model - 3 Star","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mHS-BNJnL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Vishwamoorthy","5.0","Lloyd 1.5 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC (5 in 1 Convertible, Copper, Anti-Viral + PM 2.5 Filter, 2023 Model, White, GLS18I3FWAMC)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0BRKXTSBT/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star"

"Wrong specification Listed Anti Viral PM2.5 Filter is not there in this Model, Horrible Installation","Wrong specification Listing on Amazon : Model GLS18I3FWAMC Lloyd 1.5 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC Anti Viral PM 2.5 Filter in not available in this Model (Model is Same as Listed and got the Same Model from Lloyds , So its not an issue of Wrong Product delivered) Even the Lloyds itself is not Claiming this feature in this Model. Its an Error from Amazon. Amazon should compensate me and all others who bought this AC for this missing feature. Product Quality : Using it for 5-6 days now ...was earlier using Hitachi Inverter 3 Star AC ..... Cooling is not as good as Hitachi, What's most annoying is the  Temperature Control ......even after running on best settings this AC makes you feel ""Too Cold"" & ""Too Hot"" ....very often .......I never experienced this in Hitachi Inverter AC Horrible Installation & Cheating on Installation Charges by LLoyds : Lloyds sent untrained novice technicians for installation , they have no knowledge about this AC or its features , They drilled wrong holes then forced the plastic gittis by hammer which caused breakage of most of the gittis and when I told them to screw the screws by screwdriver ..they didn't listened and hammered  the screws in the gittis (this is wrong way of doing) Not just that , they charged me Extra Rs 500- in the name of Nitrogen flushing ......which they didn't even do in the end.....and directly started the AC. I protested and told them that Nitrogen flushing is part of every installation protocols of AC's whether on new pipe line or on old pipe lines  ....But they said they will install without Nitrogen flushing and they will  not be responsible if your product gives lesser cooling and develops faults soon.

"We are a loyal customer of Amazon but now we are deeply hurt and feel cheated .","This is in regard to our recent purchase of a Lloyd Split A.C. of 'supposedly' 1.5 ton, 3 Star. We feel that the product delivered to us is of 1 ton (though the sticker on the side decodes as 1.5 ton). This was the first impression of the installer company as well as the Lloyd - Havell's technician's impression by the physical appearance. I have been calling up Amazon personel repeatedly to help us with the issue but only to hear that the Return window closed on 23 April 2023. Earlier we did not initiate a return/replacement of the AC as we are no expert in understanding the capacity and stopping installation of a product by physically seeing it. We could only question the installer/ Lloyd -Havells technician to understand what might have happened, and what their impression was about the size of the unit. We anticipate that a Lloyd-Havells 1 ton A.C has been delivered to us by Amazon, though we paid for a 1.5 ton A.C. We are deeply hurt and felt cheated. We have been an ardent and loyal customer of Amazon online sales for a very long time. Our records would show that. A few months ago we bought an LG 340 litres refrigerator. We have never found Amazon sending us wrong products erroneously. But now we are in doubt. Sincerely hoping to be heard and expecting for a resolution as soon as possible. Can we be proved that the Lloyds model supplied is genuinely a 1.5 ton 3 star split AC.","07 May 2023","Style Name: 2023 Model - 3 Star","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71I8OsuawNL._SY88.jpg

"replace my ac","The media could not be loaded. Dear team I am writing to complain about the LLYOD Inverter Air Conditioner I purchased on March 2023. The AC worked fine for a few weeks, but suddenly the compressor stopped working. Almost after 3 days, the service team came and checked the AC and said the gas leaked. The next day, they came to take the AC to their workshop for repair. I called them after two days, and they told me they would return the renovated AC within a few days. I waited a week for their response, and finally got installed the renovated AC they said the complaint occurred due to the gas leak Again after a week, an irritating sound was produced by the AC while working. I informed the service centre about it. they came and inspected the ac and took a video of the condenser unit, they said this video clip would be forwarded to the company and let me know the result. Unfortunately, the next day after their inspection, Aircondition stopped working, only the fan was working even though the compressor was ON, and the AC  was not providing cool air. what kind of build quality are you using? really sick and tired of your new air conditioner, replace me with a new unit, I don't want this welded ac (to clear the gas leak they had solder two ends of the compressor unit.). I don't want this two-month-old ac which is not working. I had to suffer a lot due to this messed up ac. My aged mother is now suffering from the heat. replace my ac with the new unit.

"After Service of Lloyd is pathetic","1. The technician will charge you 80% extra from the market price for any additional equipment. 2. You will start getting faults in the ac from the very first week of installation. 3. Lloyd customer service will not help you in any situation. 4. Every time you will see a new technician coming and finding a new problem in the AC. 5.  After a month you cannot return or exchange the item as well. 6. Technician will come and ask to pay for something which is already paid and given in the warranty otherwise they don’t even care whatever is the problem. 7. Technicians don’t carry any equipments so they can make excuses to get away from fixing the problem. 8. When you call their customer service they always say we cannot do anything, they can only forward the complaint. All of the above I experienced in the very first month of the installation.

"Initial Product Review - Pathetic Installation Experience","This is an Initial Product Review on Installation, Might update ot later after some months of Use. Product Review - Good Product at this price Range. Good Cooling capacity, sufficient for upto 160sqft room size. Good Features. Remote has radiant and good quality. Installation Review- Sum up in one word - Pathetic Experience. I used my own outdoor stand unit, when asked installation executive to use that he asked me extra installation amount than the complete installation charges. The wire for AC was charged 3X for extra requirements than what's in the box. No Branded. No reciept. The water pipe was not on the box, so executive charged me around 3X of normal market price. No reciept. The Executive do not had proper equipment or accessories, he used tapes to stick the wire on wall instead of pins. Attached Image. Over-all, it was a pathetic experience on installation part. Llyod should close their installation services. Notes for New Users- Have your own Plug before in hand. Have your own Outdoor AC Unit Stand. Have your own extra wires if switch is far away. be more vigilant when Executives asks for extra charges. I have raised a complaint with Amazon but they keep putting me on Hold. I'll escalate it to all social platforms if no action taken within time.","20 Mar 2023","Style Name: 2023 Model - 3 Star","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61AsSnsi4wL._SY88.jpg

"Horrible experience","This review is completely for both the brands not for the product. Starting with amazon delivery person was rude and delayed the delivery as he don’t want to deliver and has his own desire day for delivery. Secondly it is for Havells, they are not allowing to get it installed from any third party else the warranty of the product will end, also their brand technician is not visiting to install it, it was a very bad decision of mine to purchase this product from Amazon and a product of a brand where they don’t hve any commitment for installation. 👎👎👎","18 Apr 2023","Style Name: 2023 Model - 3 Star","","Yes","sohail","2.0","Lloyd 1.5 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC (5 in 1 Convertible, Copper, Anti-Viral + PM 2.5 Filter, 2023 Model, White, GLS18I3FWAMC)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0BRKXTSBT/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=two_star"

"Amazing Cooling Power","I would be happy to write a review for an air conditioner on Amazon! I purchased this air conditioner for my bedroom and I am blown away by its cooling power! The unit quickly cools down the room and maintains a comfortable temperature throughout the night. But what really impressed me was inspite of being small in size(indoor) it gets the job done. The unit is also incredibly easy to use. The remote control is intuitive and the LED display on the front of the unit is easy to read. I particularly appreciate the timer function, which allows me to set the unit to turn off after a certain amount of time so I don't have to worry about wasting energy. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend this air conditioner to anyone in need of a reliable, energy efficient cooling solution. Only cons i found is the size of indoor unit it looks like 1ton. But it cools the room fastly.","24 Apr 2023","Style Name: 2023 Model - 3 Star","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71h64ddXdzL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Ravi Kumar","4.0","Lloyd 1.5 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC (5 in 1 Convertible, Copper, Anti-Viral + PM 2.5 Filter, 2023 Model, White, GLS18I3FWAMC)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0BRKXTSBT/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=four_star"

Charged me like this: ₹850/m copper wire- 2 meter ₹100/m wire- 4 meter ₹850 stand ₹100 plug ₹1180 installation + gst Total 4230 which I think is a little expensive 😩 but im satisfied with the work as of now.

"Amazing AC","The air conditioner is an essential appliance for anyone living in a hot and humid climate. I recently purchased the air conditioner, and I have been extremely satisfied with its performance. One of the first things I noticed about this air conditioner is how easy it was to install. It came with clear instructions and all the necessary hardware, and I was able to get it up and running in just a few minutes. Once it was installed, I was impressed by how quickly it cooled down my room. Within minutes, I could feel a noticeable difference in the temperature. Another thing I appreciate about this air conditioner is how quiet it is. I can barely hear it running, even when I'm sitting right next to it. This is a huge plus, especially when I'm trying to sleep at night. The air conditioner also has a lot of features that make it really convenient to use. It has a remote control that allows me to adjust the temperature and fan speed from across the room, and it has a timer function that I can use to set it to turn on or off at specific times. I also like the energy-saving mode, which helps to reduce my electricity bill. Overall, I would highly recommend the air conditioner to anyone looking for a reliable, efficient, and convenient way to cool down their home or office. It's a great investment that will help you stay comfortable and productive even on the hottest days.","22 Apr 2023","Style Name: 2023 Model - 3 Star","","Yes","Prime Customer","5.0","Lloyd 1.5 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC (5 in 1 Convertible, Copper, Anti-Viral + PM 2.5 Filter, 2023 Model, White, GLS18I3FWAMC)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0BRKXTSBT/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star"
"Best inverter AC in the 1.5ton segment","I had bought the Llyod Ac 15 days ago after checking on the reviews online. This Ac is a very fast cooling one.Since the compressor unit of this ac is larger compared to other brands like voltas the cooling efficiency is better .The cooling also remains for a good amount of time as per my experience.Also the cooling temperature  need not be kept lower than 26°C for a perfect ambient atmosphere. Cheapest among other ac's in the 30k range. Also please do install a stabilizer for extra safety.","09 May 2023","Style Name: 2023 Model - 3 Star","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61569cR+24L._SY88.jpg","Yes","Sreekumar Sreejith","5.0","Lloyd 1.5 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC (5 in 1 Convertible, Copper, Anti-Viral + PM 2.5 Filter, 2023 Model, White, GLS18I3FWAMC)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0BRKXTSBT/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star"
"Great Value","Started using this AC a few days back and was very skeptical before ordering. Many of my friends said to go woth LLYOD OR VOLTAS and due I found this model from Llyod is cheaper in Amazon. Also i get 1.5ton for the price of 1 ton. Hence ordered. One thing I was very skeptical after ordering was in online model they only provide 1 year component Warranty whereas in offline model you'll get 5 year. Then after the AC arrived it was sticked in AC as 5 year Component Warranty. Then I installed Havells Sync app and registered my AC and boom... I saw my warranty has been extended. So the thing is you must register your product with Havells to claim 5 year component Warranty. When it comes to cooling, it cools my room way faster. If only got 2 way Swing but it's not a deal breaker for me atleast. Satisfied with the buy so far.","19 Apr 2023","Style Name: 2023 Model - 3 Star","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mHS-BNJnL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Vishwamoorthy","5.0","Lloyd 1.5 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC (5 in 1 Convertible, Copper, Anti-Viral + PM 2.5 Filter, 2023 Model, White, GLS18I3FWAMC)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0BRKXTSBT/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=five_star"
