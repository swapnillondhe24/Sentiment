"Effectively E-Waste if you dont listen to it in front of your computer or something","I have 2 of these, one given as a gift, one bought myself, both of these have the same issue, the second I put my phone in my pocket, the connectivity starts to die and the audio starts to cut off and on or even if I cover my ears with my hand or just simply look away from my iPad screen for more than 2 seconds, and eventually disconnects after 10-15 mins of strugging, the device I'm using this to play music with is no ordinary phone, its an iPhone 13, which should have world-class connectivity when it comes to bluetooth, I tried this with my other phones too, my Honor Play, iPad Mini 2019, Redmi Note 5 Pro and even a MacBook, the connectivity was EVEN worse than that on my iPhone. Its pretty evident that its the earphones are at fault, I don't know how people over here are saying that they are having a very good experience with these earphones, maybe they hold their phones in their hand all the time or use it with a computer in front of themü§î, worse part is that the connection drops even more in a more crowded area, for eg. a train station, they just give up in the rush hour(prolly cuz too much RF interference with the phones around them? idk). The mic just straightup sucks, the voice on the other end is utter rubbish, when I switched to the earpiece mode on my iPhone, the other end is able to hear it loud and clear, but when I switch to these, they just cant hear me. Bluetooth 5.1? Thats just for the spec sheet, yeah it connects fasts but if it has no range, its of no use either, am I right? 2 feet range, what a joke. The only reason these are even getting a 2 star rating from my end are that they have very good sound quality and are suprisingly comfortable for being 800 rupees plastic tipped earphones. After buying this, I'm gonna stay far clear from pTron, as I had another family member who bought a 3 ended(Micro USB + C + Lightning) braided pTron cable and the braid tore off revealing the white plastic cable inside, and cheap TWS earphones, I had a RealMe Buds Neo(this one didnt have bluetooth connectivity issues but as these were 2k so I ain't comparing) too in 2020, which I kept away for 4 months in 2021 and one side started having almost no sound after that along with the fact that the battery weakened so much that it was just lasting me like 30 mins of use, what a joke. I would recommend no-one to buy cheap TWS, they are just E-Waste, if you are looking for some good TWS earphones, dropping 5k+ on a pair would be an ideal bet if you would like them to last atleast 3 years, or just stick with wired, there are plenty of good sounding ones available in the 300-400 range, my personal fav is the boult bassbuds, the drivers on those are crazy good for the price, the only reason I'm out here looking for a pair of TWS is cuz my iPhone dosen't have a headphone jack or I would have sticked to wired, having a lightning converter seems awkward on my iPhone, I could go for AirPods 3 or the Pro but losing them while getting on the train or something would be a costly mishap considering I have already lost one of my old Gen 1s to the train tracks once XD, nope not again!","22 Sep 2022","Colour: Pearl White Style Name: Fute","","Yes","Tanish Singh","2.0","pTron Bassbuds Duo in Ear Earbuds with 32Hrs Total Playtime, Bluetooth 5.1 Wireless Headphones, Stereo Audio, Touch Control TWS, with Mic, Type-C Fast Charging, IPX4 & Voice Assistance (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B09DD9SX9Z/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"
"Reasonable product at this price range","After one week of use I am writing this review. Pros: 1. Good and decent sound quality what we can expect at this price range; Good bass but it overcomes voice clarity and we have to adjust the phones equaliser setting to get the ideal sound. 2. Design is good so that it sits in the ear without falling down. 3. Easily pairs without hazzle. 4. charging is ok. 5. Light weight and convenient to use. 6. Good for listening music. Cons: 1. The charging cable is very small (only few inches) and the quality is also bad. 2. The touch (button) is so sensitive and the setting changes if we accidentally touch the area which is very inconvenient. 3. Noise cancellation is very bad and it catches external air blow sounds etc. 4. Mic quality is average and we are getting complaints during voice call from the other end that the sound is not audible. 5. Above all, the delivery is very worst. Even after receiving at the destination amazon keeps it idle and delivers the next day only.","08 Apr 2023","Colour: Midnight Black Style Name: Duo","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61AtsXqFjaL._SY88.jpg

"Ok for beginners","This is a OK product if you want to try earbuds before investing into higher rate products and want to see if you can go for it. Coz thats why I bought this product for. As I felt that I might lose the product while wearing helmet or while riding. It came with additional buds which I changed to more compatible with my ear, and It didnt fell out as I feared. Audio quality was Good, mostly used it at GYM or at office calls. Not so good in noise cancellation, and the audio was also quite low when I made calls, so I restricted this only to listening to music. If you want to try earbuds for first time then this is a good product.","03 May 2023","Colour: Midnight Black Style Name: Duo","","Yes","the reader","3.0","pTron Bassbuds Duo in Ear Earbuds with 32Hrs Total Playtime, Bluetooth 5.1 Wireless Headphones, Stereo Audio, Touch Control TWS, with Mic, Type-C Fast Charging, IPX4 & Voice Assistance (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B09DD9SX9Z/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"
"Itne paise mein itna  bhi mil reha hai khaadi hai","So after watching numerous videos on youtube for a cheap tws that does the job done. I was tempted to try these out. (For the asking price of 899) Its been just 5 days so it my initial impression on this regard. 1. Pricing 10/10 2. Balanced output 9/10 3. Build quality 8/10 4. Bt range 10/10 5. Call quality 4/10 6. Battery endurance 4/10 7. Earbud fit and finish 9/10 Summary: At this price , i love it  . You get a balanced sound profile clear vocals , instruments separation you can hear throughout and bass is there but not that oomp factor one ,its passable imo. Other than that you can still hear whats around you while wearing the buds in low volume (say 20-30 %) Both buds and case are of glossy plastic material it looks good and is good in terms sturdyness though i am worried for long term appearance (scratches and tearing out of paint). Bluetooth range is good its about 10 metres as mentioned albeit walls and obstacles will interrupt at peak distances. Call audio quality is the no no point on this one ... You can hear the other person clearly along with your own voice echoeing skirmish in the background and the other person will be complaining that they can't hear your voice clearly. ( Mics are not good) Battery life of the buds so far is 2 hours 15-20ish minutes on  full volume  its perfact for my workout sessions. And you can charge the buds 3 times with provided case (dont know how fast the charge up to 100) These buds are comfortable in my opinion they dont fall off easily or hurt my ear, infact they so light weight that  you forget you are wearing them while doing activities . My only nit picking is that the case has a design flow ; you cant take out the buds swiftly it always has to two handed operation and the hinge is a little annoying for me.

"Disappointed","Basically I have 2 Disappointments 1) Product - I was expecting much after learning about the brand but unfortunately I didn't like the quality of product especially the latency of the sound during a call and sound of the voice ...and ofcourse The noise cancellation as well . 2). I wanted to return the product and go for some other product and whenever I tried to place a return order it was only directing me to a replacement of the product which was shocking and saddening for me I really hope Ptron reads this review about their product and allow me to do a return instead of replacement ...

"Best value for money","This review is after using it for about a month. Pros: 1) sound quality is really fine tuned 2) bass and all the notes are tuned very well 3) fits very comfortably and doesn't fall(even used it during my morning run) 4) connects as soon as u remove it from the case 5) buds individually offers playback arround 2-2.5 hrs. 6) good noice cancellation when ur siting still. Cons: 1) mic used are very mediocre if ur riding a bike and attend a call the other person will only listen to the wind and not ur voice. 2) connectivity is not that strong even if the phone is very near sometimes it gets lag and the music pauses for a second. 3) we get battery indicator in phone for the buds but no indication is provided for the charge  of the case. 4) only one device can be connected at a time. 5) noise cancellation takes a hot it ur riding a bike as it cannot cancel the noice due to wind. 6) no fast charging available","04 Apr 2023","Colour: Blue Style Name: Duo","","Yes","Shreyes S shalgar","4.0","pTron Bassbuds Duo in Ear Earbuds with 32Hrs Total Playtime, Bluetooth 5.1 Wireless Headphones, Stereo Audio, Touch Control TWS, with Mic, Type-C Fast Charging, IPX4 & Voice Assistance (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B09DD9SX9Z/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

"Others can't listen to your voice on calls","Pros : low cost, fits in to the ears firmly (doesn't easily fall), listening to music is enjoyable, battery backup ok (not traced exact hours, but it  is not bad for this price). Cons : Our voice clarity (also volume) for others is worst on calls, not good for recording voice/songs, feel pain in ears if we use this buds along with helmet.

"Cheapest and Usable TWS earbuds under 1000 rupees","Hi everyone, I recently purchased these ptrons cheap TWS earbuds and pretty amazed by the output they produce. These are the best TWS earbuds in 1000 rupees, well difficult to digest that TWS is now available in 1000, there was a time when it was hard to get good wired earphone for 1000 rupees, but now you can get not just Bluetooth but TWS in this price so this is how the technology has evolved a lot in last 3 years. So before diving, deeper let's see what is inside the box. a. Ptrons Tws earbuds b. Extra pair of earbuds c. a micro usb-b cable for charging d. user manual Let's bifurcate the pros and cons in detail. 1. Build quality (5/5) The build quality is great with tws earbuds having solid design and lightweight, although they are not comfortable in ears. 2.Sound quality (4/5) Sound quality is good if not the best in the price point with vocals clear but you will find distortion building up once you crank the volume above 70% which is not a big deal as these are cheap earbuds but if you will listen at 50% I think you will have the best experience 3.Deep bass. (5/5) You will find deep and punching bass though they are not tuned still you will love deep bass anyhow. 4.Noise Isolation (4/5) The noise isolation is good and offer 50-60% isolation and will work only if you have the right ear tips otherwise, noise reduction will be pretty less than what I am mentioning. 5. Button response (5/5) The button response is great without any visible delay or lag and you can do play/pause, forward/previous, Vol+/Vol- etc. The button is also bigger in comparison to other earbuds so it is easy to press and does not give pain in ears. 6. Call Quality (3.5/5) Call quality is mediocre and can be used for responding emergency calls and will not recommend to buy them for dedicated video or voice calls if you are outdoor for most of the time though they work better if you are inside as they don't have any noise reduction technique or at least I can't find that. 7. Connectivity and Comfortability (4/5) The connectivity is good and connection does not break even if you are 10 m away but comfortability is not so good as they don't fit perfectly in ears.(I have small ears but if you have big ears definitely hey will fit) 8. Battery life and charging (3.5/5) The battery life is good not the best if we consider the price and can also for around 3 hrs depends on what you are listening to what % volume Also they can roughly charge two times your earphones from empty to full and the charging case takes almost 2 hrs to charge completely. 9. Dust and water-resistant rating (3/5) There is no mention of any dust or water-resistant rating on these so if you want to use them in Gym use it on your risk as chances are you may damage them. There is a little bit of chance that they are having some sort of water-resistant but not mentioned but the chances are very slim. 10. Value for Money (5/5) Yupp, These are best TWS earbuds available in 1000 rupees in India and I have not sen any other TWS earbuds for the same price point.

"Effectively E-Waste if you dont listen to it in front of your computer or something","I have 2 of these, one given as a gift, one bought myself, both of these have the same issue, the second I put my phone in my pocket, the connectivity starts to die and the audio starts to cut off and on or even if I cover my ears with my hand or just simply look away from my iPad screen for more than 2 seconds, and eventually disconnects after 10-15 mins of strugging, the device I'm using this to play music with is no ordinary phone, its an iPhone 13, which should have world-class connectivity when it comes to bluetooth, I tried this with my other phones too, my Honor Play, iPad Mini 2019, Redmi Note 5 Pro and even a MacBook, the connectivity was EVEN worse than that on my iPhone. Its pretty evident that its the earphones are at fault, I don't know how people over here are saying that they are having a very good experience with these earphones, maybe they hold their phones in their hand all the time or use it with a computer in front of themü§î, worse part is that the connection drops even more in a more crowded area, for eg. a train station, they just give up in the rush hour(prolly cuz too much RF interference with the phones around them? idk). The mic just straightup sucks, the voice on the other end is utter rubbish, when I switched to the earpiece mode on my iPhone, the other end is able to hear it loud and clear, but when I switch to these, they just cant hear me. Bluetooth 5.1? Thats just for the spec sheet, yeah it connects fasts but if it has no range, its of no use either, am I right? 2 feet range, what a joke. The only reason these are even getting a 2 star rating from my end are that they have very good sound quality and are suprisingly comfortable for being 800 rupees plastic tipped earphones. After buying this, I'm gonna stay far clear from pTron, as I had another family member who bought a 3 ended(Micro USB + C + Lightning) braided pTron cable and the braid tore off revealing the white plastic cable inside, and cheap TWS earphones, I had a RealMe Buds Neo(this one didnt have bluetooth connectivity issues but as these were 2k so I ain't comparing) too in 2020, which I kept away for 4 months in 2021 and one side started having almost no sound after that along with the fact that the battery weakened so much that it was just lasting me like 30 mins of use, what a joke. I would recommend no-one to buy cheap TWS, they are just E-Waste, if you are looking for some good TWS earphones, dropping 5k+ on a pair would be an ideal bet if you would like them to last atleast 3 years, or just stick with wired, there are plenty of good sounding ones available in the 300-400 range, my personal fav is the boult bassbuds, the drivers on those are crazy good for the price, the only reason I'm out here looking for a pair of TWS is cuz my iPhone dosen't have a headphone jack or I would have sticked to wired, having a lightning converter seems awkward on my iPhone, I could go for AirPods 3 or the Pro but losing them while getting on the train or something would be a costly mishap considering I have already lost one of my old Gen 1s to the train tracks once XD, nope not again!","22 Sep 2022","Colour: Pearl White Style Name: Fute","","Yes","Tanish Singh","2.0","pTron Bassbuds Duo in Ear Earbuds with 32Hrs Total Playtime, Bluetooth 5.1 Wireless Headphones, Stereo Audio, Touch Control TWS, with Mic, Type-C Fast Charging, IPX4 & Voice Assistance (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B09DD9SX9Z/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"
"Reasonable product at this price range","After one week of use I am writing this review. Pros: 1. Good and decent sound quality what we can expect at this price range; Good bass but it overcomes voice clarity and we have to adjust the phones equaliser setting to get the ideal sound. 2. Design is good so that it sits in the ear without falling down. 3. Easily pairs without hazzle. 4. charging is ok. 5. Light weight and convenient to use. 6. Good for listening music. Cons: 1. The charging cable is very small (only few inches) and the quality is also bad. 2. The touch (button) is so sensitive and the setting changes if we accidentally touch the area which is very inconvenient. 3. Noise cancellation is very bad and it catches external air blow sounds etc. 4. Mic quality is average and we are getting complaints during voice call from the other end that the sound is not audible. 5. Above all, the delivery is very worst. Even after receiving at the destination amazon keeps it idle and delivers the next day only.","08 Apr 2023","Colour: Midnight Black Style Name: Duo","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61AtsXqFjaL._SY88.jpg

"Ok for beginners","This is a OK product if you want to try earbuds before investing into higher rate products and want to see if you can go for it. Coz thats why I bought this product for. As I felt that I might lose the product while wearing helmet or while riding. It came with additional buds which I changed to more compatible with my ear, and It didnt fell out as I feared. Audio quality was Good, mostly used it at GYM or at office calls. Not so good in noise cancellation, and the audio was also quite low when I made calls, so I restricted this only to listening to music. If you want to try earbuds for first time then this is a good product.","03 May 2023","Colour: Midnight Black Style Name: Duo","","Yes","the reader","3.0","pTron Bassbuds Duo in Ear Earbuds with 32Hrs Total Playtime, Bluetooth 5.1 Wireless Headphones, Stereo Audio, Touch Control TWS, with Mic, Type-C Fast Charging, IPX4 & Voice Assistance (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B09DD9SX9Z/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"
"Itne paise mein itna  bhi mil reha hai khaadi hai","So after watching numerous videos on youtube for a cheap tws that does the job done. I was tempted to try these out. (For the asking price of 899) Its been just 5 days so it my initial impression on this regard. 1. Pricing 10/10 2. Balanced output 9/10 3. Build quality 8/10 4. Bt range 10/10 5. Call quality 4/10 6. Battery endurance 4/10 7. Earbud fit and finish 9/10 Summary: At this price , i love it  . You get a balanced sound profile clear vocals , instruments separation you can hear throughout and bass is there but not that oomp factor one ,its passable imo. Other than that you can still hear whats around you while wearing the buds in low volume (say 20-30 %) Both buds and case are of glossy plastic material it looks good and is good in terms sturdyness though i am worried for long term appearance (scratches and tearing out of paint). Bluetooth range is good its about 10 metres as mentioned albeit walls and obstacles will interrupt at peak distances. Call audio quality is the no no point on this one ... You can hear the other person clearly along with your own voice echoeing skirmish in the background and the other person will be complaining that they can't hear your voice clearly. ( Mics are not good) Battery life of the buds so far is 2 hours 15-20ish minutes on  full volume  its perfact for my workout sessions. And you can charge the buds 3 times with provided case (dont know how fast the charge up to 100) These buds are comfortable in my opinion they dont fall off easily or hurt my ear, infact they so light weight that  you forget you are wearing them while doing activities . My only nit picking is that the case has a design flow ; you cant take out the buds swiftly it always has to two handed operation and the hinge is a little annoying for me.

"Disappointed","Basically I have 2 Disappointments 1) Product - I was expecting much after learning about the brand but unfortunately I didn't like the quality of product especially the latency of the sound during a call and sound of the voice ...and ofcourse The noise cancellation as well . 2). I wanted to return the product and go for some other product and whenever I tried to place a return order it was only directing me to a replacement of the product which was shocking and saddening for me I really hope Ptron reads this review about their product and allow me to do a return instead of replacement ...

"Best value for money","This review is after using it for about a month. Pros: 1) sound quality is really fine tuned 2) bass and all the notes are tuned very well 3) fits very comfortably and doesn't fall(even used it during my morning run) 4) connects as soon as u remove it from the case 5) buds individually offers playback arround 2-2.5 hrs. 6) good noice cancellation when ur siting still. Cons: 1) mic used are very mediocre if ur riding a bike and attend a call the other person will only listen to the wind and not ur voice. 2) connectivity is not that strong even if the phone is very near sometimes it gets lag and the music pauses for a second. 3) we get battery indicator in phone for the buds but no indication is provided for the charge  of the case. 4) only one device can be connected at a time. 5) noise cancellation takes a hot it ur riding a bike as it cannot cancel the noice due to wind. 6) no fast charging available","04 Apr 2023","Colour: Blue Style Name: Duo","","Yes","Shreyes S shalgar","4.0","pTron Bassbuds Duo in Ear Earbuds with 32Hrs Total Playtime, Bluetooth 5.1 Wireless Headphones, Stereo Audio, Touch Control TWS, with Mic, Type-C Fast Charging, IPX4 & Voice Assistance (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B09DD9SX9Z/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

"A Good allrounder laptop","This is the best all rounder laptop under 50K. I bought this for 45.5K (including 1500 card discount). If you are a student or working professional and your main usage depends upon productivity then you can go for it. (Not a gaming laptop!!!) Pros: 1) Display - Very good for movie watching experience. Its not IPS as per specification but it looks like an IPS panel. You cant get any other laptop with an IPS panel display under 50k with I5/R5600 H series processor. you either get a I3 or R5500U which is less powerful than R5600H processor. Check for display properties in specs sheet and get an IPS panel instead of TN. 2) Processor - Haven't checked with any heavy applications yet (try update later). As per internet, its a powerful processor equivalent to I5 H series processor. (between 40 to 60K you get processors with either U or H series mostly, where H series is more powerful than U series in terms of performance ) 3) 8GB ram & 512GB SSD - boot speed is around 5 to 7 seconds. 4) Backlight keyboard with 3 levels of brightness which is better than single level of brightness as it irritates your eyes when using in pitch darkness 5) Fingerprint sensor - Good placement of sensor and it is super fast, takes 1 to 2 seconds to unlock. 6) Lifetime MS office access Cons : 1) Speaker - I'm not sure whether I got a defective speaker, but the volume is too damn low. If the speaker volume is at 100% , Its like having 50% volume in your mobile phone. you definitely need an external speaker if you watch movies with group of people. 2) Battery - I get 3hrs on browsing and movie watching at 70% brightness. As far as I checked all laptops except apple gives an average battery life.","25 Apr 2023","Colour: Quiet Blue","","Yes","Elmer melchias","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

Also u will not get OLED laptops with ""H"" series laptop at this range ....eighter you have to compensate with the processor or the display at this price range If display is your 1st priority then go for Asus vivobook go 15 OLED.... ryzen 5 7530U around 60k(10k more + lower processor compared....which is power efficient though)","07 Apr 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613JwEuhfoL._SY88.jpg

"Edited: - Review after 15 days","So, I am using this laptop for past 15-16 days and the i am impressed with its performance the processor Ryzen 5 5600H is better than intel i5 1240P, its handles day to day tasks like browsing and watching videos and all very well and it can handle casual gaming at low and medium settings too. Coming to the display the screen is 16 inches, so it feels a bit large, but the quality of the display is above average (Good Display) but not as compared to OLED. it will give a great experience watching movies on Netflix and on prime. Sound: - The sound quality is average and it's not too loud buts considering the price its good no complains over speakers. Battery: - This is the part that amazed me, i got 6.5 - 7 hr of battery life on medium usage browsing, Running Visual Studio IDE and watching Videos the charging speed is also good it took 90 min to charge from 0 -100. Conclusion: - So, who should buy this laptop?? --- So, it's better suited for those who what to buys their 1st laptop (College Students) as well as office going peoples too can go for it. **I got this laptop for 45,490/- so it's better to buy it at 46000 or less buts if it costs more than that go for a gaming one if performance is your take.","18 Mar 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","","Yes","Devish","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

"Effectively E-Waste if you dont listen to it in front of your computer or something","I have 2 of these, one given as a gift, one bought myself, both of these have the same issue, the second I put my phone in my pocket, the connectivity starts to die and the audio starts to cut off and on or even if I cover my ears with my hand or just simply look away from my iPad screen for more than 2 seconds, and eventually disconnects after 10-15 mins of strugging, the device I'm using this to play music with is no ordinary phone, its an iPhone 13, which should have world-class connectivity when it comes to bluetooth, I tried this with my other phones too, my Honor Play, iPad Mini 2019, Redmi Note 5 Pro and even a MacBook, the connectivity was EVEN worse than that on my iPhone. Its pretty evident that its the earphones are at fault, I don't know how people over here are saying that they are having a very good experience with these earphones, maybe they hold their phones in their hand all the time or use it with a computer in front of themü§î, worse part is that the connection drops even more in a more crowded area, for eg. a train station, they just give up in the rush hour(prolly cuz too much RF interference with the phones around them? idk). The mic just straightup sucks, the voice on the other end is utter rubbish, when I switched to the earpiece mode on my iPhone, the other end is able to hear it loud and clear, but when I switch to these, they just cant hear me. Bluetooth 5.1? Thats just for the spec sheet, yeah it connects fasts but if it has no range, its of no use either, am I right? 2 feet range, what a joke. The only reason these are even getting a 2 star rating from my end are that they have very good sound quality and are suprisingly comfortable for being 800 rupees plastic tipped earphones. After buying this, I'm gonna stay far clear from pTron, as I had another family member who bought a 3 ended(Micro USB + C + Lightning) braided pTron cable and the braid tore off revealing the white plastic cable inside, and cheap TWS earphones, I had a RealMe Buds Neo(this one didnt have bluetooth connectivity issues but as these were 2k so I ain't comparing) too in 2020, which I kept away for 4 months in 2021 and one side started having almost no sound after that along with the fact that the battery weakened so much that it was just lasting me like 30 mins of use, what a joke. I would recommend no-one to buy cheap TWS, they are just E-Waste, if you are looking for some good TWS earphones, dropping 5k+ on a pair would be an ideal bet if you would like them to last atleast 3 years, or just stick with wired, there are plenty of good sounding ones available in the 300-400 range, my personal fav is the boult bassbuds, the drivers on those are crazy good for the price, the only reason I'm out here looking for a pair of TWS is cuz my iPhone dosen't have a headphone jack or I would have sticked to wired, having a lightning converter seems awkward on my iPhone, I could go for AirPods 3 or the Pro but losing them while getting on the train or something would be a costly mishap considering I have already lost one of my old Gen 1s to the train tracks once XD, nope not again!","22 Sep 2022","Colour: Pearl White Style Name: Fute","","Yes","Tanish Singh","2.0","pTron Bassbuds Duo in Ear Earbuds with 32Hrs Total Playtime, Bluetooth 5.1 Wireless Headphones, Stereo Audio, Touch Control TWS, with Mic, Type-C Fast Charging, IPX4 & Voice Assistance (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B09DD9SX9Z/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"
"Reasonable product at this price range","After one week of use I am writing this review. Pros: 1. Good and decent sound quality what we can expect at this price range; Good bass but it overcomes voice clarity and we have to adjust the phones equaliser setting to get the ideal sound. 2. Design is good so that it sits in the ear without falling down. 3. Easily pairs without hazzle. 4. charging is ok. 5. Light weight and convenient to use. 6. Good for listening music. Cons: 1. The charging cable is very small (only few inches) and the quality is also bad. 2. The touch (button) is so sensitive and the setting changes if we accidentally touch the area which is very inconvenient. 3. Noise cancellation is very bad and it catches external air blow sounds etc. 4. Mic quality is average and we are getting complaints during voice call from the other end that the sound is not audible. 5. Above all, the delivery is very worst. Even after receiving at the destination amazon keeps it idle and delivers the next day only.","08 Apr 2023","Colour: Midnight Black Style Name: Duo","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61AtsXqFjaL._SY88.jpg

"Ok for beginners","This is a OK product if you want to try earbuds before investing into higher rate products and want to see if you can go for it. Coz thats why I bought this product for. As I felt that I might lose the product while wearing helmet or while riding. It came with additional buds which I changed to more compatible with my ear, and It didnt fell out as I feared. Audio quality was Good, mostly used it at GYM or at office calls. Not so good in noise cancellation, and the audio was also quite low when I made calls, so I restricted this only to listening to music.

Bluetooth range is good its about 10 metres as mentioned albeit walls and obstacles will interrupt at peak distances. Call audio quality is the no no point on this one ... You can hear the other person clearly along with your own voice echoeing skirmish in the background and the other person will be complaining that they can't hear your voice clearly.

"A Good allrounder laptop","This is the best all rounder laptop under 50K. I bought this for 45.5K (including 1500 card discount). If you are a student or working professional and your main usage depends upon productivity then you can go for it. (Not a gaming laptop!!!) Pros: 1) Display - Very good for movie watching experience. Its not IPS as per specification but it looks like an IPS panel. You cant get any other laptop with an IPS panel display under 50k with I5/R5600 H series processor. you either get a I3 or R5500U which is less powerful than R5600H processor. Check for display properties in specs sheet and get an IPS panel instead of TN. 2) Processor - Haven't checked with any heavy applications yet (try update later). As per internet, its a powerful processor equivalent to I5 H series processor. (between 40 to 60K you get processors with either U or H series mostly, where H series is more powerful than U series in terms of performance ) 3) 8GB ram & 512GB SSD - boot speed is around 5 to 7 seconds. 4) Backlight keyboard with 3 levels of brightness which is better than single level of brightness as it irritates your eyes when using in pitch darkness 5) Fingerprint sensor - Good placement of sensor and it is super fast, takes 1 to 2 seconds to unlock. 6) Lifetime MS office access Cons : 1) Speaker - I'm not sure whether I got a defective speaker, but the volume is too damn low. If the speaker volume is at 100% , Its like having 50% volume in your mobile phone. you definitely need an external speaker if you watch movies with group of people. 2) Battery - I get 3hrs on browsing and movie watching at 70% brightness. As far as I checked all laptops except apple gives an average battery life.","25 Apr 2023","Colour: Quiet Blue","","Yes","Elmer melchias","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

Also u will not get OLED laptops with ""H"" series laptop at this range ....eighter you have to compensate with the processor or the display at this price range If display is your 1st priority then go for Asus vivobook go 15 OLED.... ryzen 5 7530U around 60k(10k more + lower processor compared....which is power efficient though)","07 Apr 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613JwEuhfoL._SY88.jpg

"Edited: - Review after 15 days","So, I am using this laptop for past 15-16 days and the i am impressed with its performance the processor Ryzen 5 5600H is better than intel i5 1240P, its handles day to day tasks like browsing and watching videos and all very well and it can handle casual gaming at low and medium settings too. Coming to the display the screen is 16 inches, so it feels a bit large, but the quality of the display is above average (Good Display) but not as compared to OLED. it will give a great experience watching movies on Netflix and on prime. Sound: - The sound quality is average and it's not too loud buts considering the price its good no complains over speakers. Battery: - This is the part that amazed me, i got 6.5 - 7 hr of battery life on medium usage browsing, Running Visual Studio IDE and watching Videos the charging speed is also good it took 90 min to charge from 0 -100. Conclusion: - So, who should buy this laptop?? --- So, it's better suited for those who what to buys their 1st laptop (College Students) as well as office going peoples too can go for it. **I got this laptop for 45,490/- so it's better to buy it at 46000 or less buts if it costs more than that go for a gaming one if performance is your take.","18 Mar 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","","Yes","Devish","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

"Effectively E-Waste if you dont listen to it in front of your computer or something","I have 2 of these, one given as a gift, one bought myself, both of these have the same issue, the second I put my phone in my pocket, the connectivity starts to die and the audio starts to cut off and on or even if I cover my ears with my hand or just simply look away from my iPad screen for more than 2 seconds, and eventually disconnects after 10-15 mins of strugging, the device I'm using this to play music with is no ordinary phone, its an iPhone 13, which should have world-class connectivity when it comes to bluetooth, I tried this with my other phones too, my Honor Play, iPad Mini 2019, Redmi Note 5 Pro and even a MacBook, the connectivity was EVEN worse than that on my iPhone. Its pretty evident that its the earphones are at fault, I don't know how people over here are saying that they are having a very good experience with these earphones, maybe they hold their phones in their hand all the time or use it with a computer in front of themü§î, worse part is that the connection drops even more in a more crowded area, for eg. a train station, they just give up in the rush hour(prolly cuz too much RF interference with the phones around them? idk). The mic just straightup sucks, the voice on the other end is utter rubbish, when I switched to the earpiece mode on my iPhone, the other end is able to hear it loud and clear, but when I switch to these, they just cant hear me. Bluetooth 5.1? Thats just for the spec sheet, yeah it connects fasts but if it has no range, its of no use either, am I right? 2 feet range, what a joke. The only reason these are even getting a 2 star rating from my end are that they have very good sound quality and are suprisingly comfortable for being 800 rupees plastic tipped earphones. After buying this, I'm gonna stay far clear from pTron, as I had another family member who bought a 3 ended(Micro USB + C + Lightning) braided pTron cable and the braid tore off revealing the white plastic cable inside, and cheap TWS earphones, I had a RealMe Buds Neo(this one didnt have bluetooth connectivity issues but as these were 2k so I ain't comparing) too in 2020, which I kept away for 4 months in 2021 and one side started having almost no sound after that along with the fact that the battery weakened so much that it was just lasting me like 30 mins of use, what a joke. I would recommend no-one to buy cheap TWS, they are just E-Waste, if you are looking for some good TWS earphones, dropping 5k+ on a pair would be an ideal bet if you would like them to last atleast 3 years, or just stick with wired, there are plenty of good sounding ones available in the 300-400 range, my personal fav is the boult bassbuds, the drivers on those are crazy good for the price, the only reason I'm out here looking for a pair of TWS is cuz my iPhone dosen't have a headphone jack or I would have sticked to wired, having a lightning converter seems awkward on my iPhone, I could go for AirPods 3 or the Pro but losing them while getting on the train or something would be a costly mishap considering I have already lost one of my old Gen 1s to the train tracks once XD, nope not again!","22 Sep 2022","Colour: Pearl White Style Name: Fute","","Yes","Tanish Singh","2.0","pTron Bassbuds Duo in Ear Earbuds with 32Hrs Total Playtime, Bluetooth 5.1 Wireless Headphones, Stereo Audio, Touch Control TWS, with Mic, Type-C Fast Charging, IPX4 & Voice Assistance (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B09DD9SX9Z/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"
"Reasonable product at this price range","After one week of use I am writing this review. Pros: 1. Good and decent sound quality what we can expect at this price range; Good bass but it overcomes voice clarity and we have to adjust the phones equaliser setting to get the ideal sound. 2. Design is good so that it sits in the ear without falling down. 3. Easily pairs without hazzle. 4. charging is ok. 5. Light weight and convenient to use. 6. Good for listening music. Cons: 1. The charging cable is very small (only few inches) and the quality is also bad. 2. The touch (button) is so sensitive and the setting changes if we accidentally touch the area which is very inconvenient. 3. Noise cancellation is very bad and it catches external air blow sounds etc. 4. Mic quality is average and we are getting complaints during voice call from the other end that the sound is not audible. 5. Above all, the delivery is very worst. Even after receiving at the destination amazon keeps it idle and delivers the next day only.","08 Apr 2023","Colour: Midnight Black Style Name: Duo","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61AtsXqFjaL._SY88.jpg

"Ok for beginners","This is a OK product if you want to try earbuds before investing into higher rate products and want to see if you can go for it. Coz thats why I bought this product for. As I felt that I might lose the product while wearing helmet or while riding. It came with additional buds which I changed to more compatible with my ear, and It didnt fell out as I feared. Audio quality was Good, mostly used it at GYM or at office calls. Not so good in noise cancellation, and the audio was also quite low when I made calls, so I restricted this only to listening to music.

Cons: 1) mic used are very mediocre if ur riding a bike and attend a call the other person will only listen to the wind and not ur voice. 2) connectivity is not that strong even if the phone is very near sometimes it gets lag and the music pauses for a second. 3) we get battery indicator in phone for the buds but no indication is provided for the charge  of the case. 4) only one device can be connected at a time. 5) noise cancellation takes a hot it ur riding a bike as it cannot cancel the noice due to wind. 6) no fast charging available","04 Apr 2023","Colour: Blue Style Name: Duo","","Yes","Shreyes S shalgar","4.0","pTron Bassbuds Duo in Ear Earbuds with 32Hrs Total Playtime, Bluetooth 5.1 Wireless Headphones, Stereo Audio, Touch Control TWS, with Mic, Type-C Fast Charging, IPX4 & Voice Assistance (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B09DD9SX9Z/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

(For the asking price of 899) Its been just 5 month's so it my initial impression on this regard. 1. Pricing 8/10 2. Balanced output 9/10 3. Build quality 8/10 4. Bt range 10/10 5. Call quality 4/10 6. Battery endurance 4/10 7. Earbud fit and finish 9/10 Summary: At this price , i love it . You get a balanced sound profile clear vocals , instruments separation you can hear throughout and bass is there but not that oomp factor one ,its passable imo. Other than that you can still hear whats around you while wearing the buds in low volume (say 10-40 %) Both buds and case are of glossy plastic material it looks good and is good in terms sturdyness though i am worried for long term appearance (scratches and tearing out of paint). Bluetooth range is good its about 10 metres as mentioned albeit walls and obstacles will interrupt at peak distances. Call audio quality is the no no point on this one ... You can hear the other person clearly along with your own voice echoeing skirmish in the background and the other person will be complaining that they can't hear your voice clearly. ( Mics are not good) Battery life of the buds so far is 2 hours 15-20ish minutes on full volume its perfact for my workout sessions. And you can charge the buds 3 times with provided case (dont know how fast the charge up to 59) These buds are comfortable in my opinion they dont fall off easily or hurt my ear, infact they so light weight that you forget you are wearing them while doing activities . My only nit picking is that the case has a design flow ; you cant take out the buds swiftly it always has to two handed operation and the hinge is a little annoying for me. Under 800 isse jyada value for money nahi milta üòÅ","22 Oct 2022","Colour: Moon White Style Name: Duo","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511fBVRfJwL._SY88.jpg

"Product valuation","after a long month of using ptron tws here is something i want to share about the product 1. Very light weight and small which increases the risk of getting lost 2.

"Others can't listen to your voice on calls","Pros : low cost, fits in to the ears firmly (doesn't easily fall), listening to music is enjoyable, battery backup ok (not traced exact hours, but it  is not bad for this price). Cons : Our voice clarity (also volume) for others is worst on calls, not good for recording voice/songs, feel pain in ears if we use this buds along with helmet. Go for it, only if you just want to listen to music only  (choose Boat/other well known brands for calling and recording voice)","17 Apr 2023","Colour: Blue Style Name: Duo","","Yes","Balaji","3.0","pTron Bassbuds Duo in Ear Earbuds with 32Hrs Total Playtime, Bluetooth 5.1 Wireless Headphones, Stereo Audio, Touch Control TWS, with Mic, Type-C Fast Charging, IPX4 & Voice Assistance (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B09DD9SX9Z/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

"Cheapest and Usable TWS earbuds under 1000 rupees","Hi everyone, I recently purchased these ptrons cheap TWS earbuds and pretty amazed by the output they produce. These are the best TWS earbuds in 1000 rupees, well difficult to digest that TWS is now available in 1000, there was a time when it was hard to get good wired earphone for 1000 rupees, but now you can get not just Bluetooth but TWS in this price so this is how the technology has evolved a lot in last 3 years. So before diving, deeper let's see what is inside the box. a. Ptrons Tws earbuds b. Extra pair of earbuds c. a micro usb-b cable for charging d. user manual Let's bifurcate the pros and cons in detail. 1. Build quality (5/5) The build quality is great with tws earbuds having solid design and lightweight, although they are not comfortable in ears. 2.Sound quality (4/5) Sound quality is good if not the best in the price point with vocals clear but you will find distortion building up once you crank the volume above 70% which is not a big deal as these are cheap earbuds but if you will listen at 50% I think you will have the best experience 3.Deep bass. (5/5) You will find deep and punching bass though they are not tuned still you will love deep bass anyhow. 4.Noise Isolation (4/5) The noise isolation is good and offer 50-60% isolation and will work only if you have the right ear tips otherwise, noise reduction will be pretty less than what I am mentioning. 5. Button response (5/5) The button response is great without any visible delay or lag and you can do play/pause, forward/previous, Vol+/Vol- etc. The button is also bigger in comparison to other earbuds so it is easy to press and does not give pain in ears. 6. Call Quality (3.5/5) Call quality is mediocre and can be used for responding emergency calls and will not recommend to buy them for dedicated video or voice calls if you are outdoor for most of the time though they work better if you are inside as they don't have any noise reduction technique or at least I can't find that. 7. Connectivity and Comfortability (4/5) The connectivity is good and connection does not break even if you are 10 m away but comfortability is not so good as they don't fit perfectly in ears.(I have small ears but if you have big ears definitely hey will fit) 8. Battery life and charging (3.5/5) The battery life is good not the best if we consider the price and can also for around 3 hrs depends on what you are listening to what % volume Also they can roughly charge two times your earphones from empty to full and the charging case takes almost 2 hrs to charge completely. 9. Dust and water-resistant rating (3/5) There is no mention of any dust or water-resistant rating on these so if you want to use them in Gym use it on your risk as chances are you may damage them. There is a little bit of chance that they are having some sort of water-resistant but not mentioned but the chances are very slim. 10. Value for Money (5/5) Yupp, These are best TWS earbuds available in 1000 rupees in India and I have not sen any other TWS earbuds for the same price point. Thee have scored 42 out of 50 in my test so pretty much usable product and not the garbage item. So looking for something in 1000 rupees go for it.","11 Nov 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/617VV53nrmL._SY88.jpg

"A Good allrounder laptop","This is the best all rounder laptop under 50K. I bought this for 45.5K (including 1500 card discount). If you are a student or working professional and your main usage depends upon productivity then you can go for it. (Not a gaming laptop!!!) Pros: 1) Display - Very good for movie watching experience. Its not IPS as per specification but it looks like an IPS panel. You cant get any other laptop with an IPS panel display under 50k with I5/R5600 H series processor. you either get a I3 or R5500U which is less powerful than R5600H processor. Check for display properties in specs sheet and get an IPS panel instead of TN. 2) Processor - Haven't checked with any heavy applications yet (try update later). As per internet, its a powerful processor equivalent to I5 H series processor. (between 40 to 60K you get processors with either U or H series mostly, where H series is more powerful than U series in terms of performance ) 3) 8GB ram & 512GB SSD - boot speed is around 5 to 7 seconds. 4) Backlight keyboard with 3 levels of brightness which is better than single level of brightness as it irritates your eyes when using in pitch darkness 5) Fingerprint sensor - Good placement of sensor and it is super fast, takes 1 to 2 seconds to unlock. 6) Lifetime MS office access Cons : 1) Speaker - I'm not sure whether I got a defective speaker, but the volume is too damn low. If the speaker volume is at 100% , Its like having 50% volume in your mobile phone. you definitely need an external speaker if you watch movies with group of people. 2) Battery - I get 3hrs on browsing and movie watching at 70% brightness. As far as I checked all laptops except apple gives an average battery life.","25 Apr 2023","Colour: Quiet Blue","","Yes","Elmer melchias","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"
"Good for college students","It's overall good product. I would say ""value for money"". As i am currently using Linux on it , it runs pretty smoothly but have some problems like most prominent one is speakers and the build quality. Speakers are too low to be used for anything, so i increased the volume by another 100% through software and now it's somewhat usable.

Ms 2021 lifetime 3. alexa , 180 degree hindge, big numpad Disadvantage according to me 1. Colors are not that much saturated {but it doesn't cause any problem... You will not fell that much of a problem is you increase brighness} If this is a problem to you then go for OLED laptops which are 10-20k higher that tis laptop ... Also u will not get OLED laptops with ""H"" series laptop at this range ....eighter you have to compensate with the processor or the display at this price range If display is your 1st priority then go for Asus vivobook go 15 OLED.... ryzen 5 7530U around 60k(10k more + lower processor compared....which is power efficient though)","07 Apr 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613JwEuhfoL._SY88.jpg

"Edited: - Review after 15 days","So, I am using this laptop for past 15-16 days and the i am impressed with its performance the processor Ryzen 5 5600H is better than intel i5 1240P, its handles day to day tasks like browsing and watching videos and all very well and it can handle casual gaming at low and medium settings too. Coming to the display the screen is 16 inches, so it feels a bit large, but the quality of the display is above average (Good Display) but not as compared to OLED. it will give a great experience watching movies on Netflix and on prime. Sound: - The sound quality is average and it's not too loud buts considering the price its good no complains over speakers. Battery: - This is the part that amazed me, i got 6.5 - 7 hr of battery life on medium usage browsing, Running Visual Studio IDE and watching Videos the charging speed is also good it took 90 min to charge from 0 -100. Conclusion: - So, who should buy this laptop?? --- So, it's better suited for those who what to buys their 1st laptop (College Students) as well as office going peoples too can go for it. **I got this laptop for 45,490/- so it's better to buy it at 46000 or less buts if it costs more than that go for a gaming one if performance is your take.","18 Mar 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","","Yes","Devish","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

"Value for money Laptop from Asus","Likes : Good screen, great design, feels expensive for the price, good price to performance ratio. It offers a new 16:10 aspect ratio in the mass market of boring laptops, build quality is way better than Lenovo and Dell. Dislike : It comes with Windows 11, Has only 1 Ssd slot. Some points to clear confusion: 1. There's 1 free Ram slot on 8 Gb model (8gb is Soldered on Motherboard) which can accommodate a 16 Gb stick making it a total of 24 Gb Ram for future. * There's no free Ram slot in 16 Gb model (8 Gb is soldered on the motherboard and there's a 8gb stick in the Ram slot, so when it comes to upgrade the Ram, you'll have to replace the 8 Gb with a 16 Gb stick and your original 8 Gb will be wasted. 2. There's only 1 SSD slot which is preoccupied with the 512 Gb ssd. You can upgrade the ssd (technically replace the current one) upto 2 TB. 3. The brightness of the screen is way better than your average Lenovo, Dell laptops. The colors are crisp and display looks great while consuming content and browsing the Internet. 4. WiFi & Bluetooth works like a charm. 5. TouchPad is good and spacious and the fingerprint reader is fast too. 6. The camera shutter is a blessing in disguise. 7. The battery backup is decent, I got around 8 hours when I was working with WiFi on and around 10 hours when I was watching TV series with WiFi off. *The screen brightness was at 40% with wired earphones. If you're someone who doesn't do hardcore gaming, needs a laptop that will help you with your work, media consumption and casual gaming, then this is your laptop. I hope this helps.","12 Apr 2023","Colour: Quiet Blue","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PvvR8-koL._SY88.jpg

"Good For Work Purpose","The media could not be loaded. My review is based on a month's use of the product. I hope you find it useful The laptop looks stylish and premium; however, only time will tell how durable it is. I use it for work-related purposes. The processor's clock speed is good, as is the performance. Highlights: 1. It looks premium (the ASUS logo is cherry) 2. The keyboard quality is good, and all essential keys are present, but what is interesting is the backlit keyboard. 3. There's no problem with the speaker quality, it's not bad, but it doesn't feel as good as Dolby audio 4. Pre-installed OS and MS Office 2021 (Home and Student) with lifetime validity. 5. Additionally, browsing speed is excellent 6. It's very difficult to carry around the laptop since it's not as lightweight as I expected. 7. With the ASUS application on your mobile device, it is easy to connect.","28 Sep 2022","Colour: Quiet Blue","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Iz9C57koL._SY88.jpg

Display is very bright with good viewing angles. Good screen for content consumption also. Speaker  sound way better then many laptop speakers in general. Its is loud for a 2W speaker along with nice clarity. Camera is HD so fulfills the purpose but obviously dnt expect mobile camera output. Its decent enough. Track pad is mega-sized so you wont be needing external mouse here. Keyboard will need some adjusting but typing experience is very good. Cons: 54k laptop comes with 8GB Ram and 512GB SSD.

"A Good allrounder laptop","This is the best all rounder laptop under 50K. I bought this for 45.5K (including 1500 card discount). If you are a student or working professional and your main usage depends upon productivity then you can go for it. (Not a gaming laptop!!!) Pros: 1) Display - Very good for movie watching experience. Its not IPS as per specification but it looks like an IPS panel. You cant get any other laptop with an IPS panel display under 50k with I5/R5600 H series processor. you either get a I3 or R5500U which is less powerful than R5600H processor. Check for display properties in specs sheet and get an IPS panel instead of TN. 2) Processor - Haven't checked with any heavy applications yet (try update later). As per internet, its a powerful processor equivalent to I5 H series processor. (between 40 to 60K you get processors with either U or H series mostly, where H series is more powerful than U series in terms of performance ) 3) 8GB ram & 512GB SSD - boot speed is around 5 to 7 seconds. 4) Backlight keyboard with 3 levels of brightness which is better than single level of brightness as it irritates your eyes when using in pitch darkness 5) Fingerprint sensor - Good placement of sensor and it is super fast, takes 1 to 2 seconds to unlock. 6) Lifetime MS office access Cons : 1) Speaker - I'm not sure whether I got a defective speaker, but the volume is too damn low. If the speaker volume is at 100% , Its like having 50% volume in your mobile phone. you definitely need an external speaker if you watch movies with group of people. 2) Battery - I get 3hrs on browsing and movie watching at 70% brightness. As far as I checked all laptops except apple gives an average battery life.","25 Apr 2023","Colour: Quiet Blue","","Yes","Elmer melchias","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"
"Good for college students","It's overall good product. I would say ""value for money"". As i am currently using Linux on it , it runs pretty smoothly but have some problems like most prominent one is speakers and the build quality. Speakers are too low to be used for anything, so i increased the volume by another 100% through software and now it's somewhat usable. Students can go for it as it offers a big display which is very helpful while learning to code.just use it little carefully as it's not that well built.","15 May 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","","Yes","Aniket Ghosh","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

You will not fell that much of a problem is you increase brighness} If this is a problem to you then go for OLED laptops which are 10-20k higher that tis laptop ... Also u will not get OLED laptops with ""H"" series laptop at this range ....eighter you have to compensate with the processor or the display at this price range If display is your 1st priority then go for Asus vivobook go 15 OLED.... ryzen 5 7530U around 60k(10k more + lower processor compared....which is power efficient though)","07 Apr 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613JwEuhfoL._SY88.jpg

"Edited: - Review after 15 days","So, I am using this laptop for past 15-16 days and the i am impressed with its performance the processor Ryzen 5 5600H is better than intel i5 1240P, its handles day to day tasks like browsing and watching videos and all very well and it can handle casual gaming at low and medium settings too. Coming to the display the screen is 16 inches, so it feels a bit large, but the quality of the display is above average (Good Display) but not as compared to OLED. it will give a great experience watching movies on Netflix and on prime. Sound: - The sound quality is average and it's not too loud buts considering the price its good no complains over speakers. Battery: - This is the part that amazed me, i got 6.5 - 7 hr of battery life on medium usage browsing, Running Visual Studio IDE and watching Videos the charging speed is also good it took 90 min to charge from 0 -100. Conclusion: - So, who should buy this laptop?? --- So, it's better suited for those who what to buys their 1st laptop (College Students) as well as office going peoples too can go for it. **I got this laptop for 45,490/- so it's better to buy it at 46000 or less buts if it costs more than that go for a gaming one if performance is your take.","18 Mar 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","","Yes","Devish","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

"Value for money Laptop from Asus","Likes : Good screen, great design, feels expensive for the price, good price to performance ratio. It offers a new 16:10 aspect ratio in the mass market of boring laptops, build quality is way better than Lenovo and Dell. Dislike : It comes with Windows 11, Has only 1 Ssd slot. Some points to clear confusion: 1. There's 1 free Ram slot on 8 Gb model (8gb is Soldered on Motherboard) which can accommodate a 16 Gb stick making it a total of 24 Gb Ram for future. * There's no free Ram slot in 16 Gb model (8 Gb is soldered on the motherboard and there's a 8gb stick in the Ram slot, so when it comes to upgrade the Ram, you'll have to replace the 8 Gb with a 16 Gb stick and your original 8 Gb will be wasted. 2. There's only 1 SSD slot which is preoccupied with the 512 Gb ssd. You can upgrade the ssd (technically replace the current one) upto 2 TB. 3. The brightness of the screen is way better than your average Lenovo, Dell laptops. The colors are crisp and display looks great while consuming content and browsing the Internet. 4. WiFi & Bluetooth works like a charm. 5. TouchPad is good and spacious and the fingerprint reader is fast too. 6. The camera shutter is a blessing in disguise. 7. The battery backup is decent, I got around 8 hours when I was working with WiFi on and around 10 hours when I was watching TV series with WiFi off. *The screen brightness was at 40% with wired earphones. If you're someone who doesn't do hardcore gaming, needs a laptop that will help you with your work, media consumption and casual gaming, then this is your laptop. I hope this helps.","12 Apr 2023","Colour: Quiet Blue","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PvvR8-koL._SY88.jpg

"Good For Work Purpose","The media could not be loaded. My review is based on a month's use of the product. I hope you find it useful The laptop looks stylish and premium; however, only time will tell how durable it is. I use it for work-related purposes. The processor's clock speed is good, as is the performance. Highlights: 1. It looks premium (the ASUS logo is cherry) 2. The keyboard quality is good, and all essential keys are present, but what is interesting is the backlit keyboard. 3. There's no problem with the speaker quality, it's not bad, but it doesn't feel as good as Dolby audio 4. Pre-installed OS and MS Office 2021 (Home and Student) with lifetime validity. 5. Additionally, browsing speed is excellent 6. It's very difficult to carry around the laptop since it's not as lightweight as I expected. 7. With the ASUS application on your mobile device, it is easy to connect.","28 Sep 2022","Colour: Quiet Blue","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Iz9C57koL._SY88.jpg

"Best budget Office Laptop","If you are a gamer, please skip this product. Strictly for office work. Build quality is just amazing. Battery on daily average usage goes upto 7+hours. Display is very bright with good viewing angles. Good screen for content consumption also. Speaker  sound way better then many laptop speakers in general. Its is loud for a 2W speaker along with nice clarity. Camera is HD so fulfills the purpose but obviously dnt expect mobile camera output. Its decent enough. Track pad is mega-sized so you wont be needing external mouse here. Keyboard will need some adjusting but typing experience is very good. Cons: 54k laptop comes with 8GB Ram and 512GB SSD.

"A Good allrounder laptop","This is the best all rounder laptop under 50K. I bought this for 45.5K (including 1500 card discount). If you are a student or working professional and your main usage depends upon productivity then you can go for it. (Not a gaming laptop!!!) Pros: 1) Display - Very good for movie watching experience. Its not IPS as per specification but it looks like an IPS panel. You cant get any other laptop with an IPS panel display under 50k with I5/R5600 H series processor. you either get a I3 or R5500U which is less powerful than R5600H processor. Check for display properties in specs sheet and get an IPS panel instead of TN. 2) Processor - Haven't checked with any heavy applications yet (try update later). As per internet, its a powerful processor equivalent to I5 H series processor. (between 40 to 60K you get processors with either U or H series mostly, where H series is more powerful than U series in terms of performance ) 3) 8GB ram & 512GB SSD - boot speed is around 5 to 7 seconds. 4) Backlight keyboard with 3 levels of brightness which is better than single level of brightness as it irritates your eyes when using in pitch darkness 5) Fingerprint sensor - Good placement of sensor and it is super fast, takes 1 to 2 seconds to unlock. 6) Lifetime MS office access Cons : 1) Speaker - I'm not sure whether I got a defective speaker, but the volume is too damn low. If the speaker volume is at 100% , Its like having 50% volume in your mobile phone. you definitely need an external speaker if you watch movies with group of people. 2) Battery - I get 3hrs on browsing and movie watching at 70% brightness.

"Edited: - Review after 15 days","So, I am using this laptop for past 15-16 days and the i am impressed with its performance the processor Ryzen 5 5600H is better than intel i5 1240P, its handles day to day tasks like browsing and watching videos and all very well and it can handle casual gaming at low and medium settings too. Coming to the display the screen is 16 inches, so it feels a bit large, but the quality of the display is above average (Good Display) but not as compared to OLED. it will give a great experience watching movies on Netflix and on prime. Sound: - The sound quality is average and it's not too loud buts considering the price its good no complains over speakers. Battery: - This is the part that amazed me, i got 6.5 - 7 hr of battery life on medium usage browsing, Running Visual Studio IDE and watching Videos the charging speed is also good it took 90 min to charge from 0 -100. Conclusion: - So, who should buy this laptop?? --- So, it's better suited for those who what to buys their 1st laptop (College Students) as well as office going peoples too can go for it. **I got this laptop for 45,490/- so it's better to buy it at 46000 or less buts if it costs more than that go for a gaming one if performance is your take.","18 Mar 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","","Yes","Devish","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

"Value for money Laptop from Asus","Likes : Good screen, great design, feels expensive for the price, good price to performance ratio. It offers a new 16:10 aspect ratio in the mass market of boring laptops, build quality is way better than Lenovo and Dell. Dislike : It comes with Windows 11, Has only 1 Ssd slot. Some points to clear confusion: 1. There's 1 free Ram slot on 8 Gb model (8gb is Soldered on Motherboard) which can accommodate a 16 Gb stick making it a total of 24 Gb Ram for future. * There's no free Ram slot in 16 Gb model (8 Gb is soldered on the motherboard and there's a 8gb stick in the Ram slot, so when it comes to upgrade the Ram, you'll have to replace the 8 Gb with a 16 Gb stick and your original 8 Gb will be wasted. 2. There's only 1 SSD slot which is preoccupied with the 512 Gb ssd. You can upgrade the ssd (technically replace the current one) upto 2 TB. 3. The brightness of the screen is way better than your average Lenovo, Dell laptops. The colors are crisp and display looks great while consuming content and browsing the Internet. 4. WiFi & Bluetooth works like a charm. 5. TouchPad is good and spacious and the fingerprint reader is fast too. 6. The camera shutter is a blessing in disguise. 7. The battery backup is decent, I got around 8 hours when I was working with WiFi on and around 10 hours when I was watching TV series with WiFi off. *The screen brightness was at 40% with wired earphones. If you're someone who doesn't do hardcore gaming, needs a laptop that will help you with your work, media consumption and casual gaming, then this is your laptop. I hope this helps.","12 Apr 2023","Colour: Quiet Blue","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PvvR8-koL._SY88.jpg

"Good For Work Purpose","The media could not be loaded. My review is based on a month's use of the product. I hope you find it useful The laptop looks stylish and premium; however, only time will tell how durable it is. I use it for work-related purposes. The processor's clock speed is good, as is the performance. Highlights: 1. It looks premium (the ASUS logo is cherry) 2. The keyboard quality is good, and all essential keys are present, but what is interesting is the backlit keyboard. 3. There's no problem with the speaker quality, it's not bad, but it doesn't feel as good as Dolby audio 4. Pre-installed OS and MS Office 2021 (Home and Student) with lifetime validity. 5. Additionally, browsing speed is excellent 6. It's very difficult to carry around the laptop since it's not as lightweight as I expected. 7. With the ASUS application on your mobile device, it is easy to connect.","28 Sep 2022","Colour: Quiet Blue","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Iz9C57koL._SY88.jpg

"A Good allrounder laptop","This is the best all rounder laptop under 50K. I bought this for 45.5K (including 1500 card discount). If you are a student or working professional and your main usage depends upon productivity then you can go for it. (Not a gaming laptop!!!) Pros: 1) Display - Very good for movie watching experience. Its not IPS as per specification but it looks like an IPS panel. You cant get any other laptop with an IPS panel display under 50k with I5/R5600 H series processor. you either get a I3 or R5500U which is less powerful than R5600H processor. Check for display properties in specs sheet and get an IPS panel instead of TN. 2) Processor - Haven't checked with any heavy applications yet (try update later). As per internet, its a powerful processor equivalent to I5 H series processor. (between 40 to 60K you get processors with either U or H series mostly, where H series is more powerful than U series in terms of performance ) 3) 8GB ram & 512GB SSD - boot speed is around 5 to 7 seconds. 4) Backlight keyboard with 3 levels of brightness which is better than single level of brightness as it irritates your eyes when using in pitch darkness 5) Fingerprint sensor - Good placement of sensor and it is super fast, takes 1 to 2 seconds to unlock. 6) Lifetime MS office access Cons : 1) Speaker - I'm not sure whether I got a defective speaker, but the volume is too damn low. If the speaker volume is at 100% , Its like having 50% volume in your mobile phone. you definitely need an external speaker if you watch movies with group of people. 2) Battery - I get 3hrs on browsing and movie watching at 70% brightness. As far as I checked all laptops except apple gives an average battery life.","25 Apr 2023","Colour: Quiet Blue","","Yes","Elmer melchias","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

As i am currently using Linux on it , it runs pretty smoothly but have some problems like most prominent one is speakers and the build quality. Speakers are too low to be used for anything, so i increased the volume by another 100% through software and now it's somewhat usable.

"Edited: - Review after 15 days","So, I am using this laptop for past 15-16 days and the i am impressed with its performance the processor Ryzen 5 5600H is better than intel i5 1240P, its handles day to day tasks like browsing and watching videos and all very well and it can handle casual gaming at low and medium settings too. Coming to the display the screen is 16 inches, so it feels a bit large, but the quality of the display is above average (Good Display) but not as compared to OLED. it will give a great experience watching movies on Netflix and on prime. Sound: - The sound quality is average and it's not too loud buts considering the price its good no complains over speakers. Battery: - This is the part that amazed me, i got 6.5 - 7 hr of battery life on medium usage browsing, Running Visual Studio IDE and watching Videos the charging speed is also good it took 90 min to charge from 0 -100. Conclusion: - So, who should buy this laptop?? --- So, it's better suited for those who what to buys their 1st laptop (College Students) as well as office going peoples too can go for it. **I got this laptop for 45,490/- so it's better to buy it at 46000 or less buts if it costs more than that go for a gaming one if performance is your take.","18 Mar 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","","Yes","Devish","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

"Value for money Laptop from Asus","Likes : Good screen, great design, feels expensive for the price, good price to performance ratio. It offers a new 16:10 aspect ratio in the mass market of boring laptops, build quality is way better than Lenovo and Dell. Dislike : It comes with Windows 11, Has only 1 Ssd slot. Some points to clear confusion: 1. There's 1 free Ram slot on 8 Gb model (8gb is Soldered on Motherboard) which can accommodate a 16 Gb stick making it a total of 24 Gb Ram for future. * There's no free Ram slot in 16 Gb model (8 Gb is soldered on the motherboard and there's a 8gb stick in the Ram slot, so when it comes to upgrade the Ram, you'll have to replace the 8 Gb with a 16 Gb stick and your original 8 Gb will be wasted. 2. There's only 1 SSD slot which is preoccupied with the 512 Gb ssd. You can upgrade the ssd (technically replace the current one) upto 2 TB. 3. The brightness of the screen is way better than your average Lenovo, Dell laptops. The colors are crisp and display looks great while consuming content and browsing the Internet. 4. WiFi & Bluetooth works like a charm. 5. TouchPad is good and spacious and the fingerprint reader is fast too. 6. The camera shutter is a blessing in disguise. 7. The battery backup is decent, I got around 8 hours when I was working with WiFi on and around 10 hours when I was watching TV series with WiFi off. *The screen brightness was at 40% with wired earphones. If you're someone who doesn't do hardcore gaming, needs a laptop that will help you with your work, media consumption and casual gaming, then this is your laptop. I hope this helps.","12 Apr 2023","Colour: Quiet Blue","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PvvR8-koL._SY88.jpg

"Good For Work Purpose","The media could not be loaded. My review is based on a month's use of the product. I hope you find it useful The laptop looks stylish and premium; however, only time will tell how durable it is. I use it for work-related purposes. The processor's clock speed is good, as is the performance. Highlights: 1. It looks premium (the ASUS logo is cherry) 2. The keyboard quality is good, and all essential keys are present, but what is interesting is the backlit keyboard. 3. There's no problem with the speaker quality, it's not bad, but it doesn't feel as good as Dolby audio 4. Pre-installed OS and MS Office 2021 (Home and Student) with lifetime validity. 5. Additionally, browsing speed is excellent 6. It's very difficult to carry around the laptop since it's not as lightweight as I expected. 7. With the ASUS application on your mobile device, it is easy to connect.","28 Sep 2022","Colour: Quiet Blue","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Iz9C57koL._SY88.jpg

"A Good allrounder laptop","This is the best all rounder laptop under 50K. I bought this for 45.5K (including 1500 card discount). If you are a student or working professional and your main usage depends upon productivity then you can go for it. (Not a gaming laptop!!!) Pros: 1) Display - Very good for movie watching experience. Its not IPS as per specification but it looks like an IPS panel. You cant get any other laptop with an IPS panel display under 50k with I5/R5600 H series processor. you either get a I3 or R5500U which is less powerful than R5600H processor. Check for display properties in specs sheet and get an IPS panel instead of TN. 2) Processor - Haven't checked with any heavy applications yet (try update later). As per internet, its a powerful processor equivalent to I5 H series processor. (between 40 to 60K you get processors with either U or H series mostly, where H series is more powerful than U series in terms of performance ) 3) 8GB ram & 512GB SSD - boot speed is around 5 to 7 seconds. 4) Backlight keyboard with 3 levels of brightness which is better than single level of brightness as it irritates your eyes when using in pitch darkness 5) Fingerprint sensor - Good placement of sensor and it is super fast, takes 1 to 2 seconds to unlock. 6) Lifetime MS office access Cons : 1) Speaker - I'm not sure whether I got a defective speaker, but the volume is too damn low. If the speaker volume is at 100% , Its like having 50% volume in your mobile phone. you definitely need an external speaker if you watch movies with group of people. 2) Battery - I get 3hrs on browsing and movie watching at 70% brightness. As far as I checked all laptops except apple gives an average battery life.","25 Apr 2023","Colour: Quiet Blue","","Yes","Elmer melchias","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"
"Good for college students","It's overall good product. I would say ""value for money"". As i am currently using Linux on it , it runs pretty smoothly but have some problems like most prominent one is speakers and the build quality. Speakers are too low to be used for anything, so i increased the volume by another 100% through software and now it's somewhat usable. Students can go for it as it offers a big display which is very helpful while learning to code.just use it little carefully as it's not that well built.","15 May 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","","Yes","Aniket Ghosh","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

You will not fell that much of a problem is you increase brighness} If this is a problem to you then go for OLED laptops which are 10-20k higher that tis laptop ... Also u will not get OLED laptops with ""H"" series laptop at this range ....eighter you have to compensate with the processor or the display at this price range If display is your 1st priority then go for Asus vivobook go 15 OLED.... ryzen 5 7530U around 60k(10k more + lower processor compared....which is power efficient though)","07 Apr 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613JwEuhfoL._SY88.jpg

"Edited: - Review after 15 days","So, I am using this laptop for past 15-16 days and the i am impressed with its performance the processor Ryzen 5 5600H is better than intel i5 1240P, its handles day to day tasks like browsing and watching videos and all very well and it can handle casual gaming at low and medium settings too. Coming to the display the screen is 16 inches, so it feels a bit large, but the quality of the display is above average (Good Display) but not as compared to OLED. it will give a great experience watching movies on Netflix and on prime. Sound: - The sound quality is average and it's not too loud buts considering the price its good no complains over speakers. Battery: - This is the part that amazed me, i got 6.5 - 7 hr of battery life on medium usage browsing, Running Visual Studio IDE and watching Videos the charging speed is also good it took 90 min to charge from 0 -100. Conclusion: - So, who should buy this laptop?? --- So, it's better suited for those who what to buys their 1st laptop (College Students) as well as office going peoples too can go for it. **I got this laptop for 45,490/- so it's better to buy it at 46000 or less buts if it costs more than that go for a gaming one if performance is your take.","18 Mar 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","","Yes","Devish","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

"Value for money Laptop from Asus","Likes : Good screen, great design, feels expensive for the price, good price to performance ratio. It offers a new 16:10 aspect ratio in the mass market of boring laptops, build quality is way better than Lenovo and Dell. Dislike : It comes with Windows 11, Has only 1 Ssd slot. Some points to clear confusion: 1. There's 1 free Ram slot on 8 Gb model (8gb is Soldered on Motherboard) which can accommodate a 16 Gb stick making it a total of 24 Gb Ram for future. * There's no free Ram slot in 16 Gb model (8 Gb is soldered on the motherboard and there's a 8gb stick in the Ram slot, so when it comes to upgrade the Ram, you'll have to replace the 8 Gb with a 16 Gb stick and your original 8 Gb will be wasted. 2. There's only 1 SSD slot which is preoccupied with the 512 Gb ssd. You can upgrade the ssd (technically replace the current one) upto 2 TB. 3. The brightness of the screen is way better than your average Lenovo, Dell laptops. The colors are crisp and display looks great while consuming content and browsing the Internet. 4. WiFi & Bluetooth works like a charm. 5. TouchPad is good and spacious and the fingerprint reader is fast too. 6. The camera shutter is a blessing in disguise. 7. The battery backup is decent, I got around 8 hours when I was working with WiFi on and around 10 hours when I was watching TV series with WiFi off. *The screen brightness was at 40% with wired earphones. If you're someone who doesn't do hardcore gaming, needs a laptop that will help you with your work, media consumption and casual gaming, then this is your laptop. I hope this helps.","12 Apr 2023","Colour: Quiet Blue","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PvvR8-koL._SY88.jpg

"Good For Work Purpose","The media could not be loaded. My review is based on a month's use of the product. I hope you find it useful The laptop looks stylish and premium; however, only time will tell how durable it is. I use it for work-related purposes. The processor's clock speed is good, as is the performance. Highlights: 1. It looks premium (the ASUS logo is cherry) 2. The keyboard quality is good, and all essential keys are present, but what is interesting is the backlit keyboard. 3. There's no problem with the speaker quality, it's not bad, but it doesn't feel as good as Dolby audio 4. Pre-installed OS and MS Office 2021 (Home and Student) with lifetime validity. 5. Additionally, browsing speed is excellent 6. It's very difficult to carry around the laptop since it's not as lightweight as I expected. 7. With the ASUS application on your mobile device, it is easy to connect.","28 Sep 2022","Colour: Quiet Blue","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Iz9C57koL._SY88.jpg

Display is very bright with good viewing angles. Good screen for content consumption also. Speaker  sound way better then many laptop speakers in general. Its is loud for a 2W speaker along with nice clarity. Camera is HD so fulfills the purpose but obviously dnt expect mobile camera output. Its decent enough. Track pad is mega-sized so you wont be needing external mouse here. Keyboard will need some adjusting but typing experience is very good. Cons: 54k laptop comes with 8GB Ram and 512GB SSD.

"A Good allrounder laptop","This is the best all rounder laptop under 50K. I bought this for 45.5K (including 1500 card discount). If you are a student or working professional and your main usage depends upon productivity then you can go for it. (Not a gaming laptop!!!) Pros: 1) Display - Very good for movie watching experience. Its not IPS as per specification but it looks like an IPS panel. You cant get any other laptop with an IPS panel display under 50k with I5/R5600 H series processor. you either get a I3 or R5500U which is less powerful than R5600H processor. Check for display properties in specs sheet and get an IPS panel instead of TN. 2) Processor - Haven't checked with any heavy applications yet (try update later). As per internet, its a powerful processor equivalent to I5 H series processor. (between 40 to 60K you get processors with either U or H series mostly, where H series is more powerful than U series in terms of performance ) 3) 8GB ram & 512GB SSD - boot speed is around 5 to 7 seconds. 4) Backlight keyboard with 3 levels of brightness which is better than single level of brightness as it irritates your eyes when using in pitch darkness 5) Fingerprint sensor - Good placement of sensor and it is super fast, takes 1 to 2 seconds to unlock. 6) Lifetime MS office access Cons : 1) Speaker - I'm not sure whether I got a defective speaker, but the volume is too damn low. If the speaker volume is at 100% , Its like having 50% volume in your mobile phone. you definitely need an external speaker if you watch movies with group of people. 2) Battery - I get 3hrs on browsing and movie watching at 70% brightness. As far as I checked all laptops except apple gives an average battery life.","25 Apr 2023","Colour: Quiet Blue","","Yes","Elmer melchias","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"
"Good for college students","It's overall good product. I would say ""value for money"". As i am currently using Linux on it , it runs pretty smoothly but have some problems like most prominent one is speakers and the build quality. Speakers are too low to be used for anything, so i increased the volume by another 100% through software and now it's somewhat usable. Students can go for it as it offers a big display which is very helpful while learning to code.just use it little carefully as it's not that well built.","15 May 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","","Yes","Aniket Ghosh","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

Ms 2021 lifetime 3. alexa , 180 degree hindge, big numpad Disadvantage according to me 1. Colors are not that much saturated {but it doesn't cause any problem... You will not fell that much of a problem is you increase brighness} If this is a problem to you then go for OLED laptops which are 10-20k higher that tis laptop ... Also u will not get OLED laptops with ""H"" series laptop at this range ....eighter you have to compensate with the processor or the display at this price range If display is your 1st priority then go for Asus vivobook go 15 OLED.... ryzen 5 7530U around 60k(10k more + lower processor compared....which is power efficient though)","07 Apr 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613JwEuhfoL._SY88.jpg

"Edited: - Review after 15 days","So, I am using this laptop for past 15-16 days and the i am impressed with its performance the processor Ryzen 5 5600H is better than intel i5 1240P, its handles day to day tasks like browsing and watching videos and all very well and it can handle casual gaming at low and medium settings too. Coming to the display the screen is 16 inches, so it feels a bit large, but the quality of the display is above average (Good Display) but not as compared to OLED. it will give a great experience watching movies on Netflix and on prime. Sound: - The sound quality is average and it's not too loud buts considering the price its good no complains over speakers. Battery: - This is the part that amazed me, i got 6.5 - 7 hr of battery life on medium usage browsing, Running Visual Studio IDE and watching Videos the charging speed is also good it took 90 min to charge from 0 -100. Conclusion: - So, who should buy this laptop?? --- So, it's better suited for those who what to buys their 1st laptop (College Students) as well as office going peoples too can go for it. **I got this laptop for 45,490/- so it's better to buy it at 46000 or less buts if it costs more than that go for a gaming one if performance is your take.","18 Mar 2023","Colour: Transparent Silver","","Yes","Devish","4.0","ASUS Vivobook 16X (2022), 16.0-inch (40.64 cms) FHD+ 16:10, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H, Thin and Laptop (8GB/512GB SSD/Integrated Graphics/Windows 11/Office 2021/Silver/1.80 kg), M1603QA-MB501WS","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B0B8ZT96HS?ref_=Oct_DLandingS_D_e9b39fbe_0/ref=cm_cr_unknown?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=1"

"Value for money Laptop from Asus","Likes : Good screen, great design, feels expensive for the price, good price to performance ratio. It offers a new 16:10 aspect ratio in the mass market of boring laptops, build quality is way better than Lenovo and Dell. Dislike : It comes with Windows 11, Has only 1 Ssd slot. Some points to clear confusion: 1. There's 1 free Ram slot on 8 Gb model (8gb is Soldered on Motherboard) which can accommodate a 16 Gb stick making it a total of 24 Gb Ram for future. * There's no free Ram slot in 16 Gb model (8 Gb is soldered on the motherboard and there's a 8gb stick in the Ram slot, so when it comes to upgrade the Ram, you'll have to replace the 8 Gb with a 16 Gb stick and your original 8 Gb will be wasted. 2. There's only 1 SSD slot which is preoccupied with the 512 Gb ssd. You can upgrade the ssd (technically replace the current one) upto 2 TB. 3. The brightness of the screen is way better than your average Lenovo, Dell laptops. The colors are crisp and display looks great while consuming content and browsing the Internet. 4. WiFi & Bluetooth works like a charm. 5. TouchPad is good and spacious and the fingerprint reader is fast too. 6. The camera shutter is a blessing in disguise. 7. The battery backup is decent, I got around 8 hours when I was working with WiFi on and around 10 hours when I was watching TV series with WiFi off. *The screen brightness was at 40% with wired earphones. If you're someone who doesn't do hardcore gaming, needs a laptop that will help you with your work, media consumption and casual gaming, then this is your laptop. I hope this helps.","12 Apr 2023","Colour: Quiet Blue","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PvvR8-koL._SY88.jpg

"Good For Work Purpose","The media could not be loaded. My review is based on a month's use of the product. I hope you find it useful The laptop looks stylish and premium; however, only time will tell how durable it is. I use it for work-related purposes. The processor's clock speed is good, as is the performance. Highlights: 1. It looks premium (the ASUS logo is cherry) 2. The keyboard quality is good, and all essential keys are present, but what is interesting is the backlit keyboard. 3. There's no problem with the speaker quality, it's not bad, but it doesn't feel as good as Dolby audio 4. Pre-installed OS and MS Office 2021 (Home and Student) with lifetime validity. 5. Additionally, browsing speed is excellent 6. It's very difficult to carry around the laptop since it's not as lightweight as I expected. 7. With the ASUS application on your mobile device, it is easy to connect.","28 Sep 2022","Colour: Quiet Blue","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Iz9C57koL._SY88.jpg

"Best budget Office Laptop","If you are a gamer, please skip this product. Strictly for office work. Build quality is just amazing. Battery on daily average usage goes upto 7+hours. Display is very bright with good viewing angles. Good screen for content consumption also. Speaker  sound way better then many laptop speakers in general. Its is loud for a 2W speaker along with nice clarity. Camera is HD so fulfills the purpose but obviously dnt expect mobile camera output. Its decent enough. Track pad is mega-sized so you wont be needing external mouse here. Keyboard will need some adjusting but typing experience is very good. Cons: 54k laptop comes with 8GB Ram and 512GB SSD.
