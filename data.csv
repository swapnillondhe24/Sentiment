Longterm review Fanless Wonder,"I had fears about getting a laptop with passive cooling, even though I don't do video editing or compile big programs on the Air, even for web development and writing small scripts a fanless laptop seemed like a bad idea but after using this I can this thing is totally fine and wonderful Docker works fine some issues do come up but for simple development of C++, Python apps along with Postgres SQL docker with some configurations the M1 chip has so far caused no issues. I run vscode, pycharm the project is not too huge but with safari or chrome running with 6-8 tabs this wonder does not heat up or cause any instability. The display is the best I have used so far, the speakers are far better than equivalent windows laptops Some Cons: 1) No simple keyboard shortcut to control keyboard backlighting, 2) As a long-term windows user, the shortcuts like arrow key + Win key to resize apps/stack apps is something I truly miss, Mac does have its own multitasking/split screen way but I prefer windows installing a third party for this seems unnecessary 3) Battery life on 12.4 is a bit less than when I got the MacBook Air 4) Switching to Mac shortcuts takes a bit of time 5) Need to buy a type C Dongle, as I work of ethernet port mostly",09 Jul 2022,,,Yes,Ben,5.0,"Apple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop M1 chip, 13.3-inch/33.74 cm Retina Display, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Storage, Backlit Keyboard, FaceTime HD Camera, Touch ID.

M1 8gb vs 16gb confusion?,"Should i buy the 16gb ram from apple store? This was the question i had for a long time. After going through tons of videos that compares 8gb air vs 16gb there was a clear evidence that with my use i can still be happy with the m1 8gb ram variant. This is not a long term review but i shall update the review after few months of usage. Why i opted for 8gb ram? My use is browsing some secure pages, maybe watch some videos too. Use imovies to edit small videos (not heavy 4k long videos as such) but i have seen that this can support even editing 4k videos. But then definitely if you are someone who use it majorly for editing 4k videos then you should probably get the 16gb variant. Then i do a little bit of coding too. I do have a office laptop that is a 16gb ram intel one. I did try opening some youtube 4k vids in chrome and compared it side by side and initial impression is pretty good on how the m1 takes on the load. But I should wait for more to get the actual picture. So, if you are light user with basic use and not into gaming or anything. This laptop is gonna be more than enough for your use. As its very much portable and light weight. The battery is also heavily optimised. ( i tried all these and i am yet to do my initial charging üòä). I shall update my review after 3-6 months for a better comparison. ***update after 10 months ***** No regrets! This is super fast engine. I do a lot of coding now with this. I feel every software works like a charm in M1 now. Of course we have the updated processor now.

Very reliable and worth of each penny spent,"Hi, I have been an apple user- still have an old 2011 model. Then i switched back to dell for around 4 years. It's all good and smooth with Dell. And very recently I thought let me buy myself an Air. I like that its super sleek and somehow grey color is one of my favourites. So no surprizes the laptop comes in a nice packaging, (thanks to amazon for there on time and easy delivery). The only con of apple air is that its pricey but yes (if you are like me-you will realise its soon that in a long run, how this becomes such an important part of your life, its much more cheaper in value) Super Pro's 1. M1 processors are highly efficient in processing. Also thanks to SSD 2. Battery life is crazy- last for 15-16 hours easily 3. Look and Design (there's not much to say- its very obvious)- Super classy, sleek and very light weight. Con's 1. No cons It's the best version of any Macbooks till date. To be honest, I do multiple things- I design, I edit videos, I code, and I browse. Everything is good. I wish I could have ordered a bigger storage one though which was a bit expensive for me. So I treated myself with a very handy Seagate SSD 500 GB and I use it on the fly. Something extra to carry but I still LOVE it. Also, to let you know that- this is one of my first review that's written so throughly. So understand the excitement and satisfaction level of this product. WISH YOU LUCK! Now go and Buy. :)",05 Jun 2021,,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Q0GpaLbnL._SY88.jpg

"APPLE M1 2020 IS A GOOD LAPTOP AS A HARDWARE PIECE, BUT SOFTWARE PLATFORM SUCKS.","Apple Macbook M1 2020 edition is an excellent piece of hardware bundle but the software platform is not suitable for many of the applications which work only on Windows PC. If and if only Apple sells its Macbooks for Windows operating system, it would be really a 10 STAR device. Pros: * Excellent SOC (System on chip) which is beyond any comparison. Intel and AMD have been left miles beyond. Their processors are antiquated & far short in performance. * The processor does not generate any heat - which indicates the cool operation and also low power consumption. There is no cooling fan in the laptop. The entire unit is sealed as there is no heat venting. * Battery lasts very loooong, even for HQ 16 K video playback. * Display is very realistic with true colours. * Sound quality is great. Channel separation is so good, you feel theatre like effect with sounds coming from all directions, far and near. Cons: * Very poor or no scope for expanding the RAM and storage size. * Software is expensive. * Additional compatible peripherals are mighty expensive. * Such pricey laptops come with only 1 year warranty. * Other than 2 C type ports and a earphone jack nothing else is present. One C port is engaged for power supply. Thus one has inflexibility of having to do with only one H.Speed ""C"" type USB port. * Windows users switching to Apple are cautioned. Compatibility, storage space, expandability are severely constrained. Finally, like the PC's which can take MS Windows OS and also other OS platforms, Apple range of MacBooks should also be compatible universally for all platforms, with hardware expandability options like PCs. with any Operating systems.",25 Jun 2021,,,Yes,Krishna,4.0,"Apple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop M1 chip, 13.3-inch/33.74 cm Retina Display, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD Storage, Backlit Keyboard, FaceTime HD Camera, Touch ID.

"A little overpriced in India, but worth the money as an apple product!","Skipping the technical part since I'm sure most know about the M1 chip already. As a first time Mac user, I would say, switching to Mac from Windows was a very good experience for me. I didn't face any major issues. All I can say is that for professional and non-gaming use, this device is a monster. 11 hours of battery life easily, with video calls and multiple tabs and apps, along with windows on parallels ON, the whole working day! I never felt that I lacked anything. Even when there were power cuts, you can easily tether your phone or even better if you have an Iphone, and still keep going as if the power is still ON. From performance to battery life, design, everything is amazing. But do know that you'll need to keep an extra 10 thousand rupees spare to get accessories which are essential, such as cover, hubs etc. But overall a great buy as a minimum 5 year investment, and you can still expect some resale value. I was bit disappointed with the Amazon delivery executive though, he simple left the item with the watchman without taking the OTP and he then calls up for it.

Value for money so far,"My first Mac, so far had no issues, in 15 days hanged once for 15 secs during shutdown, else everything is good. Absolutely no noise and no heating. Battery backup average 9-10 hours for moderate usage (browsing, movie, youtube, streaming etc). If pocket permits then you can have this blindly without even attempt to comparing with other PC. Updates on 14th Apr'22 Well! Performance is still good but a big problem appeared in battery. Randomly shutting down with 74% battery left without any warning. It doesn't turn on until I plug the power adapter. When the laptop opens it shows battery at 11% and takes very little time (10-15 mins) to reach 100% battery level. Then after I unplug, from 100% to reach 74% it takes normal time (no abrupt drainage here), but once it goes around 74% it again shuts down, and the loop continues. However no problem while keeping on power. But this is not good sign from such a costly device. Not sure on if battery is required to be replaced. If someone knows a solution please let me know, this may help others also.

I am not sure if its worth the money though as its pretty expensive for the basic model which is 86900 inr.

Best laptop in the market today!,The M1 based MacBook Air is simply the best laptop you can buy right now. With the MacBook Pro also using the M1 it's the first time in years that the Air's specs are almost identical to the Pro's at a much lower price point. For those worried most common applications like Chrome are already available native for M1. Other non native apps also work flawlessly. Pros: 1. Noiseless 2. High screen clarity 3. Battery life of 3-5 days on average use 4. Very light 5. Fingerprint sensor 6. Keyboard is so nice you feel like typing more Cons: 1.
